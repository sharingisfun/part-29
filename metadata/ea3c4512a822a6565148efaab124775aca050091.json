David Blatt, 2 November 1938, New York) is a singer, also known as &quot;The Voice,&quot; whose height of fame came in the 1960s when he was the lead singer of the band Jay and the Americans. The band had numerous hits including &quot;Cara Mia&quot;, &quot;Come a Little Bit Closer&quot;, and &quot;This Magic Moment.&quot; Black grew up in Brooklyn, New York in the neighborhood of Boro Park. In his later career, he has become known for touring New York State and Florida singing, mainly solo, and preceding his singing with a stand-up comedy routine. Black has been widely criticized for his vulgarity during these routines, once receiving a letter from New York Governor George Pataki warning Black to keep his act clean when he performs in New York State parks. Jay and his brother speak Yiddish fluently and Jay has been known to speak to his brother on his mobile phone in Yiddish.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3c4512a822a6565148efaab124775aca050091","amp;dn":"Jay+Black+And+The+Americans+-+Cara+Mia+%28Live%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3c4512a822a6565148efaab124775aca050091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,60,69,18,168,34,166,86,81,72,239,170,177,36,119,90,202,5,0,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
