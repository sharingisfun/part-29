An 8-year-old American boy wakes up alone in a rice paddy in a rural Chinese province with no idea how he got there. Details start to emerge when the boy, who calls himself Jacob, recalls that his hometown is Arcadia, and an Immigration agent, J. Martin Bellamy, takes him there. The home he claims as his own is occupied by an elderly couple, Henry and Lucille Langston, who lost their son, Jacob, more than 30 years ago. While they look different, young Jacob recognizes them as his parents. Those closest to the family try to unravel this impossible mystery - but this boy who claims to be the deceased Jacob knows secrets about his own death that no one else knows. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9b5c64af5ab9d0ce7c77347345e4f6895228448","amp;dn":"Resurrection.US.S01E01.Xvid-AJAXEN.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9b5c64af5ab9d0ce7c77347345e4f6895228448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,181,198,74,245,171,157,12,231,199,115,71,52,94,79,104,149,34,132,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
