Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Forgotten HeroesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ he describes he and his fellow captives as in a voice which retains its bitterness at their being an overlooked element of the Dunkirk legend.\n\n\n2) A sergeant (who went on to work for the BBC) remembers his impressions of the retreat. His shame at Ã¢â‚¬Å“liberatingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ jewellery and furs, and disposing of his rifle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for which he had no ammunition left Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are palpable, as is his horror at seeing his comrade swept into the wake of their rescue ship. The picture of him being rescued naked twice is not quite the image we have of the rescued soldiers!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab826f7516f5af380b44649e4c075cc61d4da04","amp;dn":"Dunkirk+-+Two+BBC+Eyewitness+accounts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab826f7516f5af380b44649e4c075cc61d4da04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,184,38,247,81,111,90,243,128,180,70,73,228,192,117,204,97,212,218,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
