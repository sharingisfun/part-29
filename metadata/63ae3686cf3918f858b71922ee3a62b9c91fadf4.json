John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War. He requests a position on the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out he is not alone, but meets a wolf he dubs &quot;Two-socks&quot; and a curious Indian tribe. Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, and discovers a white woman who was raised by the Indians. He gradually earns the respect of these native people, and sheds his white-man's ways. \n\nDirector: Kevin Costner\nWriters: Michael Blake (screenplay), Michael Blake (novel)\nStars: Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099348/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099348/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical information\nRUNTIME.......: 3h:53m:49s\nSIZE..........: 27.5 GB\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264, CRF18, L4.1\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\nBITRATE.......: Variable ~ 14908 Kbps\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x812 (2.35:1)\nAUDIO 1.......: English DTS 5.1 @ 1509 Kbps\nAUDIO 2.......: Commentary by Director Kevin Costner and Producer Jim Wilson\nAUDIO 3.......: Commentary by Director of Photography Dean Semler and Editor Neil Travis\nSUBTITLES.....: English (+Forced), Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, French, Greek, Hungarian, Polish,Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Vietnamese\nCHAPTERS......: Yes (named)\nSOURCE........: 1080p BluRay AVC DTS-HD MA 7.1 20th Anniversary MGM (thx Renner)\n\nENCODER.......: Nick007\nRELEASE DATE..: 05/05/2011\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ae3686cf3918f858b71922ee3a62b9c91fadf4","amp;dn":"Dances.With.Wolves.1990.EXT.1080p.BluRay.x264-DON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ae3686cf3918f858b71922ee3a62b9c91fadf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,174,54,134,207,57,24,248,88,183,25,34,238,58,98,185,201,31,173,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
