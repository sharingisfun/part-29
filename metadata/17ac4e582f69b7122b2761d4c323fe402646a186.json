For the first time since she was a young girl her time is her own, her body is her own, her thoughts are her own. In solitude, she is finally able to reflect on her own existence and its meaning,  bringing her a semblance of inner peace. Scenes from her former life shuttle through her mind: how owner after owner assaulted her, and how each of her babies were taken away as soon as they were weaned, their futures left to her imagination. We are the sole witnesses to her history: her capture as a child, her tortured days in a harbor city on the eastern coast as a servant, her journey with her last owner and protector, her flight, and the kaleidoscopic world of her baobab tree. Wilma Stockenstrom's profound work of narrative fiction, translated by Nobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee, is a rare, haunting exploration of enslavement and freedom.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;This mini-masterpiece is less a novel than an intimate monologue illuminating the nature of slavery, oppression, womanhood, identity, Africa, and nature itself. . . . 25 years after its introduction to English-speaking audiences, this tale still proves moving and vibrant.&quot; -- Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n&quot;A meditation on humanity, mortality and time. A challenging, compelling work.&quot; -- Kirkus Reviews\n\n&quot;[The Expedition to the Baobab Tree] left me entranced and devastated. . . At the very least, this slim work (not a novella, as that category seemingly exists just to diminish the importance of short literature of quality) should be on every postcolonial studies reading list. . . The frequently hallucinatory and fantastical prose-poetry, while inventive, is not merely a linguistic flourish; it is a political statement, the fierce rejection of &quot;Western,&quot; specifically patriarchal, practices of reading the world.&quot; -- Charles Shafaieh, The Daily Beast\n\n&quot;An astonishing achievement.&quot; --The Star (South Africa)\n\n&quot;A truly remarkable contribution, both for the lyrical quality of its prose and for its boldly imaginative theme.&quot; --World Literature Today\n\n&quot;Lyrical ... dramatic ... epic. Of the living, active poets in Afrikaans she is the greatest.&quot; --Andre Brink, author of Philida and A Dry White Season\n\n&quot;A compelling, richly textured fable.&quot; --Christopher Hope, author of Shooting Angels\n\n&quot;Let me immediately say that this book gripped me from the very first paragraph and I could not put it down till I closed it late last night, deeply moved, with the realization: Today I read a great work.&quot; --Audrey Blignault, South African Broadcasting Corporation\n\n&quot;A poignant reflection on death and the psyche of a human being.&quot; --Rapport\n\n&quot;An evocative historical novella.&quot; -- Breyten Breytenbach\n\n&quot;A work of brilliance, breathtaking, a relentless work that pushes the reader through a forced-open doorway between worlds, and then through another doorway, and then another, and then back the way she came, and then shows how all boundaries are dark illusions, labels we force onto categories of experience in lives that can't be planned, or that can't be planned by us.&quot; -- Elizabeth Bachner\n\n&quot;From its stunning first lines to its beautiful last, J.M. Coetzee's brilliant Englishing of Wilma Stokenstrom's The Expedition to the Baobab Tree had its tendrils wrapped tight around me. Rarely in a novelÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œand never in one this slenderÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œhave I encountered such power, such tenderness, such elegance, such ferocity.&quot; -- Laird Hun\n\n&quot;A slave woman remembers her life as her survival becomes more uncertain in the African grasslands. The knowledge that she can make the decision about where her body will go is simultaneously liberating and frightening. Readers become one in the mind and imagination with her as she sorts through the meaning of her lifelong bondage in the fortress of a baobab tree.&quot; -- World Literature Today\n\n&quot;This J.M. Coetzee-translated novel of a young African girl's life, memory, and survival by one of the most important writers on the continent is one of the year's most important books in translation&quot; -- Flavorwire","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17ac4e582f69b7122b2761d4c323fe402646a186","amp;dn":"Wilma+Stockenstrom+-+The+Expedition+to+the+Baobab+Tree+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17ac4e582f69b7122b2761d4c323fe402646a186","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,172,78,88,47,105,183,18,43,39,97,212,195,35,254,64,38,70,161,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
