However, they end up with a foul-mouthed 12-year-old and his younger brother. Dumped on Eric and Phil by a caseworker, the kids soon become permanent houseguests. Phil is quickly won over, but Eric proves a harder nut to crack, especially when the kids&amp;#039; mother, an alcoholic prostitute, moves in. Get Your Stuff premiered at the 2000 San Francisco Lesbian &amp; Gay Festival. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, All Movie Guide\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff93158ea84652dbac3b470c84aaa4a9a021892f","amp;dn":"Get+Your+Stuff+%282000%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff93158ea84652dbac3b470c84aaa4a9a021892f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,147,21,142,168,70,82,219,172,59,71,12,132,170,164,169,160,33,137,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
