Cacek's wryly witty romp introduces Allison Garret -- thirtysomething, biological clock loudly ticking and perpetually unlucky inlife and love. But it will take more than luck when she wakes up in a seedy motel room...as a vampire! In a rollicking tour of the seamy underbelly of L.A., Allison hooks up with a young Bible-thumping street corner preacher, but they'll both need more than a night full of prayers to escape the clutches of a catty coven of strip club vampires out for blood.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1092234.Night_Prayers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1092234.Night_Prayers&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d594dfd90fcc31adf4ceb0ec3567236bf8e2a3e","amp;dn":"Night+Prayers+by+PD+Cacek+%28epub%2C+mobi%2C+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d594dfd90fcc31adf4ceb0ec3567236bf8e2a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,89,77,253,144,252,195,26,223,76,235,14,195,86,114,54,191,142,42,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
