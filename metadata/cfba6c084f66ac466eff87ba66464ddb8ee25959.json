It started on \nthe internet where U.S native Ron Martin and Italian Marco Zanzi shared a love of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœclassic country rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and corresponded regularly. The same musical tastes but separated by the broad Atlantic Ocean as well as a section of the Mediterranean! It is too long a story to go into here but gradually they and other collaborators such as Mike Gallivan on bass and guitars, Katherine Walczyk, vocals, and a few more from each of the two countries have got together physically and electronically to play and record the country rock and folk music they all have a deep abiding love for. However, perhaps due to their love of the music that is so obvious to anyone who has listened to them, they have been able to draw other hugely talented musicians into their musical fold, many of them genuine Ã¢â‚¬ËœlegendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of country rock. On this album we have Richie Furay, (Buffalo Springfield, Southern-Hillman-Furay Band, Poco, Solo) Rick Roberts (FBB, Firefall), Gene Parsons (Nashville West, Byrds, FBB, Parsons Green), Buddy Cage (New Riders of the Purple Sage), Patrick Shanahan (Rick NelsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Stone Canyon Band, New Riders of the Purple Sage) and Stephen A. Love (Stone Canyon Band, New Riders Of The Purple Sage, Roger McGuinn), with several of the above also being present on their earlier release Ã¢â‚¬ËœPBIII.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ \nYou could be forgiven for thinking this is going to be an album containing nothing but country rock but it \nisnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t! There are several songs that have more in common with British isles folk music, a duo of genres that in many ways are at opposite extremes of roots music. As if that is not enough, little is done to try to blend those genres and \nensure they are closer together, other than perhaps a little folksy instrumentation sometimes bleeding into the country rock, thus they provide some lovely contrasts in the music that is played with such commitment, flair and \nconviction. To say it works beautifully is an understatement. Such is the quality of writing and musicianship that it just adds diversity to another tremendous PBB album. Much of their music whether country rock or folk seems to \nhave that almost indefinable Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhigh lonesome soundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ providing an atmosphere that tugs at the emotions irrespective of lyrical content. They are certainly an unusual band in this 21st century with their classic take on both country rock and folk making them, in some ways, a throwback to the early 1970s, but such is the quality of songwriting and musicianship that there is no disjointedness, instead becoming an epic album that almost defines the melody driven branches of roots music..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfba6c084f66ac466eff87ba66464ddb8ee25959","amp;dn":"Piedmont+Brothers+Band+-+Back+To+The+Country+%5B2013%5DFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfba6c084f66ac466eff87ba66464ddb8ee25959","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,186,108,8,79,102,172,70,110,255,135,186,102,70,77,219,142,226,89,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
