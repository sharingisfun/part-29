I haven't tried anything new. This is from a while back. It is difficult to do. I have a mac on one boot and win 8 on the other. Garage Band works better than any Windows software. But mostly...this is Elvis Costello. I put his voice in the same area as Michael Stipes from REM. They both sing kinda of the same to me. I am not sure if they sing a little of pitch on purpose or what it is I notice but it is difficult to match. I wanted to upload something and I haven't been on the mac recently.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bed5772c1ac4a4a3fce70e3ee9ddc44fca25bf5","amp;dn":"rockinghorse+road.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bed5772c1ac4a4a3fce70e3ee9ddc44fca25bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,237,87,114,193,172,74,74,63,206,112,227,238,157,220,68,252,162,91,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
