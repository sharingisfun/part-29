This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.Originally broadcast in two parts, on December 26th, 1970 and January second, 1971, this is American Top 40's first year end countdown.\n\nThis is the only AT40 countdown where you will hear many of these songs because the first broadcast didn't take place until July of 1970. About half of these hits occurred in the first half of the year.\n\nCasey tells of the five songs from commercials that became pop hit in the past five years. Three of these songs sold Pepsi, Alka-Seltzer, and cigarettes.\n\nThere are old radio commercials from 1970, and Casey lists the top five albums of the year.\n\nOne artist in the countdown is the only solo singer in chart history to have ever had a number one song while he was still in grade school.\n\nMotown has nine hits in the top 80 and the Jackson Five sing four of those.\n\n80: The Letter - Joe Cocker\n79: I Want To Take You Higher - Ike and Tina Turner\n78: Mississippi Queen - Mountain\n77: For The Love Of Him - Bobbi Martin\n76: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Shame - Spinners\n75: I Just Can't Help Believing - B.J.
