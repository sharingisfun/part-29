Had he never opened his mouth, Allison's piquant mix of tart blues and pre-rock pop impressionism could have fueled a solid career as a pianist working through post-bop and cool jazz stratagems. But his deep feeling for classic blues and R&amp;B, a poker-faced vocal mien gifted with razor-sharp timing, and an often mordant world-view translated to a long string of classic jazz vocal performances that mix humor, rue, and introspection to unique effect. This terrific 2 CD anthology culls definitive studio performances and smart live performances that canvass his &quot;cotton sack&quot; vignettes (including his own sophisticated variants on Delta blues and shrewd investigations of Percy Mayfield and Willie Dixon), shaggy dog stories, and secular sermons. ~ Sam Sutherland \n\nMose Allison is the ultimate hipster: his laconic yet never lazy delivery as smooth as a sunny summer afternoon breeze, his songs wry and sardonic set pieces filled with just the right amount of irony and wit, the music surrounding them uncluttered and casual. This double CD set of his &quot;best&quot; material gives casual buyers a superb overview of the man's fifty years in the biz. It starts with early cuts for Riverside in the fifties and winds on down through his Atlantic years (thanks to keenly biting songs like &quot;Your Mind Is On Vacation&quot; and &quot;Your Molecular Structure&quot;) and ends up in the late eighties and mid nineties for Blue Note. Especially cool is hearing a grand cut like &quot;Ever Since The World Ended&quot;, a post-Apocalypse blues that's genuinely funny and heart-warming at the same time (it's taken from the album of the same name on Blue Note, a totally recommended yet sadly deleted disc should the reader come across it). Here's the amazing thing: whether you listen to a classic like &quot;Parchman's Farm&quot; or his most recent material, Mose Allison sounds like he hasn't aged. Or maybe it's just that then and now, he was/is always just that much more ahead of us. We are not worthy! But we'll gladly enjoy this great anthology! ~ Ralph Quirino\nThis is prima facie evidence that Mose Allison is an underappreciated jazz giant. Without question the hippest, wittiest, coolest, swingingest songwriter, pianist, and singer ever to rise from the Mississippi Delta, Mose is a delight in every respect, a writer's writer and performer's performer who has been deeply influential in both style and substance for over three generations, from the fifties through the new century. His songs have been praised and covered by a panoply of greats: The Rolling Stones, John Mayall, J. J. Cale, The Who, The Yardbirds, The Clash, Leon Russell, Van Morrison, Elvis Costello, and many more. If you don't know him, you owe it to yourself to discover him, and this album is the perfect place to start. If you already know him, you need this album, as it has all of his greatest songs. It's a gas! ~ T.
