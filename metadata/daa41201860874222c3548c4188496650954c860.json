Released in 2001, it was her first new solo album since 1994&amp;#039;s Street Angel. The album returned Nicks to the top 5 for the first time since 1983&amp;#039;s The Wild Heart, and achieved Gold status within six weeks of its release for sales of over 500,000 copies in the U.S. As of May 2008, the album has sold 660,000 copies in the US. [1]\n\nShortly after the somewhat muted reception to her previous album, Street Angel, Nicks asked close friend Tom Petty to help her write and record a new album. Petty advised her that she did not need any help and to have more faith in her own abilities, which Nicks recounts in the track &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot;. Later revitalised by the successful reformation of Fleetwood Mac for their live album and video &quot;The Dance&quot;, Nicks then proceeded to record her new material, enlisting the help of Sheryl Crow, who had been a fan of Nicks for some years. Crow contributed the song &quot;It&amp;#039;s Only Love&quot;, and performed on and co-produced several tracks. The two became good friends and Nicks, in return, performed on Crow&amp;#039;s &quot;C&amp;#039;Mon C&amp;#039;Mon&quot; album. The pair have also performed on stage together numerous times since the 1990s. When Crow&amp;#039;s own career commitments prevented her from completing work on the album, Nicks enlisted the help of John Shanks, who had sent her a demo of the track &quot;Every Day&quot;.\n\n   1. &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:50\n   2. &quot;Candlebright&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:41\n   3. &quot;Sorcerer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:55\n   4. &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:46\n   5. &quot;Every Day&quot; (John Shanks, Damon Johnson) ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:36\n   6. &quot;Too Far from Texas&quot; (Steve Booker, Sandy Stewart) ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:48\n          * performed by Stevie Nicks &amp; Natalie Maines (of The Dixie Chicks)\n   7. &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot; ÃƒÂ¢??
