Caesar becomes sexually obsessed by the 18 year old queen, beds her, and eventually has a son by her. However, his Roman followers and his wife are not pleased by the union. In fact, as Caesar has only a daughter by his wife, he had picked Octavian as his successor. The out-of-wedlock son of Cleopatra is seen to be a threat to his future leadership. Thus Brutus and other Roman legislators plot the assassination of Caesar. Caesar's loyal general, Marc Antony, and Octavian then divide up the Roman empire. Antony takes Egypt and soon takes up the affair with Cleopatra. However, Octavian soon launches an attack on Antony and ultimately defeats and mortally wounds him. Rather than permitting herself to be humiliated by Octavian, Cleopatra sends her son away to India and she commits suicide by permitting the deadly asp to bite her.\n\nDirector: Franc Roddam\n\nCountry: Germany | USA \n\n\n=================================\n\n\nGeneral\nCleopatra.1999.[Dual-EN-PT].[FilmesEpicos.com].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.42 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 29mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 360 Kbps\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 29mn\nBit rate                         : 958 Kbps\nWidth                            : 544 pixels\nHeight                           : 392 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.388\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #1  ENGLISH\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 2h 29mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\n\nAudio #2  PORTUGUESE\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 2h 29mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\n\n\nSUBTITLES:   SRT (optional) - Portuguese BR\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe05125b56f8bce6451ae12e3bee7bcb9ce74806","amp;dn":"Cleopatra.1999.%5BDual-EN-PT%5D.%5BFilmesEpicos.com%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe05125b56f8bce6451ae12e3bee7bcb9ce74806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,5,18,91,86,248,188,230,69,26,225,46,59,238,123,203,156,231,72,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
