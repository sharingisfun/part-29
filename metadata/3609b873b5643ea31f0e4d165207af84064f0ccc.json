Life 'n Perspective of a Genuine Crossover sounds aimless where its predecessor came off as shrewdly eclectic. It's not that there aren't great moments: &quot;Careless&quot; is nice mid-tempo hip-hop with a blues base, and the strangely named &quot;(Thru) the Gates of the Big Fruit&quot; showcases some great turntable work from DJ DNA as well as country-ish slide guitar from Tres Manos. But the four-part approach to &quot;Life 'n Perspectives&quot; is annoying and &quot;Routine&quot; goes nowhere. Somehow the high points aren't quite enough to carry the weight of the low ones. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\nWas their superb debut already a exciting mix of musical styles, this album is maybe even more eclectic. In general it is a bit more rock-guitar oriented than Mental Floss... but it still tries to combine all musical styles in one song. Unfortunately, it does not work for all songs (Duck Ska or Mr. Ezway), but they are overshadowed by gems like Routine (reason enough to buy this album), Comeback and Harvey Quinnt.\n\nUrban Dance Squad should be superstars in the US by now, with albums like this, which is easily as good as anything the Red Hot Chili Peppers ever cranked out, not to mention Rage Against The Machine. Oh well, it's your loss Yankees.
