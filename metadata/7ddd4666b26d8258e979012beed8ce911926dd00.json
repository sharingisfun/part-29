Styles vary from silky skinny scarfs, funky brimmed hats and chic city sets to a pretty lace shawl and cute mittens. It takes into account the exciting choice of yarns available to the modern knitter, and focuses on using these to maximum effect. Variation ideas take the projects further, showing different patterns, yarns and styles through detailed photography and colourful artworks. Easy-to-follow techniques ensure great results, whether giving a simple scarf a professional finish, or adding an eyecatching trim to an embellished hat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ddd4666b26d8258e979012beed8ce911926dd00","amp;dn":"The+Knitter%27s+Bible%3A+Knitted+Accessories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ddd4666b26d8258e979012beed8ce911926dd00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,221,70,102,178,109,130,88,233,121,1,43,238,216,206,145,25,38,221,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
