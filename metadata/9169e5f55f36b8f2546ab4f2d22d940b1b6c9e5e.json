The album, produced by Dark New Day's Brett Hestla, has all of the elements of a future mainstream smash. The first single, &quot;Hear Me Now&quot;, has already been in the top 20 on Sirius Octane's most requested list for months.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nMoment by Framing Hanley welds earnest emo gestures to heavy-edged modern rock, coming off somewhere on the spectrum between Incubus' post-grunge alt rock and Fall Out Boy's cresting emo attack. (The Nashville band could also safely be compared to 30 Seconds to Mars.) The lead single &quot;Hear Me Now&quot; pits ominous metal-lite guitar tones against the kind of emo pain that only kids in tight jeans, wristbands, and eyeliner can fully understand (&quot;Now my body's on the floor and I am calling, I'm calling out to you/Can you hear me now?), complete with a shrieking vocal counterattack beneath the soul-baring sentiments. &quot;All in Your Hands&quot; owes a more straight-up debt to Incubus, with spiraling metal-lite cloudbursts of guitars dropping love bombs beneath high-wire vocal keening. &quot;Built for Sin&quot; trades in on the old sensitive brooding verse/high cries metal guitar chorus formula that has served numerous emo groups so well, while &quot;Alone in This Bed&quot; provides the requisite change-up: a heart-tugging love ballad with acoustic guitar opening and sweeping, grandiose flourishes. This a well-constructed album, but it's so highly derivative and so one-note emotionally that it becomes anesthetizing. We get it: you're in pain and you miss her. Anything else new under the sun?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9169e5f55f36b8f2546ab4f2d22d940b1b6c9e5e","amp;dn":"Framing+Hanley+-+The+Moment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9169e5f55f36b8f2546ab4f2d22d940b1b6c9e5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,105,229,245,95,54,184,242,84,106,180,242,210,45,148,11,27,108,158,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
