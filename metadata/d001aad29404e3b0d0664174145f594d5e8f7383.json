With her debut EP being released back in 2011, Jo Whitby soon decided that she wanted to record an album and thus Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Diary of MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was born.\n\nAfter raising the money to record the album by using the ever so popular method of crowd funding, Jo recorded Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Diary of MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in her bedroom in Cardiff as well as her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ house on the other side of Severn, over in Bristol. Whitby writes plays and sings on almost every track on the album bar a few in which she drafted in a handful of talented artists to collaborate with including Salwa Azar (vocals and lyrics: Ã¢â‚¬ËœPaper ChainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), Ash Cooke (guitar, synths and voice: Ã¢â‚¬ËœBetween DestinationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) and Paul Foster a.k.a Dementio13 .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d001aad29404e3b0d0664174145f594d5e8f7383","amp;dn":"The+Diary+Of+Me+-+Laurence+Made+Me+Cry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d001aad29404e3b0d0664174145f594d5e8f7383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,1,170,210,148,4,227,176,208,102,65,116,20,95,89,77,94,143,115,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
