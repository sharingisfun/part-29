Many blurbs such as this are written without a thorough reading of the book. Not so in this case. I read it and love it. I suggest you do the same.Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Richard Saul Wurman\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“It is a dream book, we were waiting forÃ¢â‚¬Â¦on the field of information. On top of the incredible amount of presented knowledge this is also a beautifully designed piece, very easy to followÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Krzysztof Lenk, author of Mapping Websites: Digital Media Design\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Having had the pleasure of a sneak preview, I can only say that this is a magnificent achievement: a combination of intelligent text, fascinating insights and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ oh yes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ graphics. Congratulations to Joel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Judith Harris, author of Pompeii Awakened: A Story of Rediscovery\n\nDesigning Information shows designers in all fields Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from user-interface design to architecture and engineering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how to design complex data and information for meaning, relevance, and clarity. Written by a worldwide authority on the visualization of complex information, this full-color, heavily illustrated guide provides real-life problems and examples as well as hypothetical and historical examples, demonstrating the conceptual and pragmatic aspects of human factors-driven information design. Both successful and failed design examples are included to help readers understand the principles under discussion.
