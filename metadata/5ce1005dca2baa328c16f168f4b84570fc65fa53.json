According to urban legend, the comic book said somethings it was not supposed to talk about.\n\nThe artist, JÃƒÂ³zsef Haui is not among the most well known comic book authors in Hungary either, and at least to my knowledge, he only made a handful of titles so far.\n\nThe adventures of the 3 young astronauts have seen 3 comic book adaptations, the first of which ('Az Ã…Â±rkalÃƒÂ³zok fogsÃƒÂ¡gÃƒÂ¡ban') was drawn by another artist, Attila Fazekas. This story was published later on in Czechoslovakia  and Poland as well.\n\nIn the ENG scan, I tried to stay as close to the style of the original, as I could. For some it might seem a bit dull, but then, so was Communism, according to many...  \n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nThis is the V1.1 version, before proof-reading and following Colour/Brightness adjustment.\n\nAnybody would feel like giving a try to proof-read this title, let me know! \n\n\nCheck SWATura torrents for other hard-to-find classics!\n\n(K) Kopyleft 2013 - All Rites Reversed...\n\np.s.
