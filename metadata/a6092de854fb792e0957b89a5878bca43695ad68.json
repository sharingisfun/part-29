This collection of eighteen of Mark Twain's best short stories, including both the well known and the lesser known, displays his mastery of Western humor and frontier realism, the qualities for which he is best known. The stories also show how Twain earned his place in American letters as a master writer in the authentic native idiom. He was exuberant and irreverent, but underlying the humor was a vigorous desire for social justice and equality.\n\nBeginning the collection is Twain's comic version of an old folk tale, Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog, first published in 1865 in the New York Saturday Press. It became the title story of The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County and Other Sketches, published in 1867, which was the work that established him as a leading American humorist. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6092de854fb792e0957b89a5878bca43695ad68","amp;dn":"THE+BEST+SHORT+STORIES+OF+MARK+TWAIN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6092de854fb792e0957b89a5878bca43695ad68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,9,45,232,84,251,121,46,9,87,184,154,88,120,188,164,54,149,173,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
