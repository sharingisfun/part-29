Homesteading in the Carolina mountains, Sevier was too busy fighting Indians and taming the wilderness to worry much about a far-off war, but when an arrogant British officer sends a message over the mountains, threatening to burn the settlers' farms and kill their families, the war becomes personal.\n\nThat abrasive officer is British Army Major Patrick Ferguson, who is both charmingly antagonistic and surprisingly endearing.
