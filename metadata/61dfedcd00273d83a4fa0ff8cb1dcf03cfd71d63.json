Fernandez's celebrated melodrama tells the story of one such dancer, Mercedes (Marga Lopez) who must fight off the attentions of an abusive pimp while working to finance the schooling of her younger sister. A danzon contest offers salvation, but will Mercedes see her chance of redemption cruelly snatched away? Deliciously dark with noir overtones, its fine performances are matched by Gabriel Figueroa's superlative cinematography.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m44/okty1/SALON%20MEXICO/a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m44/okty1/SALON%20MEXICO/a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m44/okty1/SALON%20MEXICO/b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m44/okty1/SALON%20MEXICO/b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m44/okty1/SALON%20MEXICO/c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m44/okty1/SALON%20MEXICO/c.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m44/okty1/SALON%20MEXICO/e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m44/okty1/SALON%20MEXICO/e.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe star of the film is really Figueroa's cinematography. He turns a few recurring motifs (e.g the dance sequences, the staircase to the heroine's apartment) into anchors. That and the rock-solid acting help give the melodramatic plot enough weight to work as a sort of lower-class tragedy. The story is simple. A woman works as a dance hall girl in order to put her sister through boarding school, the sister's only chance to make it out of the otherwise impenetrable class barrier. She runs into trouble with a third-rate hoodlum over some money they win in a dance contest. That relationship eventually undoes her. Figueroa shoots the film in high-contrast black and white with intensive use of spot lighting. This gives even continuous group scenes something of the feeling of montage. This gives him a continuous palette of edits ranging from soviet-style montage, to rapid cut closeups of individuals lit by themselves, to medium range scenes where the characters are foregrounded and backgrounded using spots, all the way to simple outdoor scenes shot in natural lighting (reserved for moments when we are in or near high-society). The music is quite good. The egregiously sexual dances give one a much clearer sense of the emotions driving the Salon than any description could. The bookend mariachi &quot;Si Juarez..&quot; (If Juarez had not died) is amazingly poignant close to the story.\n\n\n--------not my rip---------\n\nName.........: Salon Mexico.avi\nFilesize.....: 633 MB (or 648,942 KB or 664,516,688 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:30:36 (130,336 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 854 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 115 kb/s (57/ch, stereo) VBR\nFrame Size...: 576x448 (1.29:1) [=9:7]\n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
