This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast there is a chart first. Two members of the same group have top 40 hits at the same time while the group is still active. It happens in the second hour.\n\nThe Go-Go's have their first chart single with &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; (at number 35), as does Al Jarreau with &quot;We're In This Love Together&quot; (at number 15).\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;Who were the first brother and sister duo to hit number one?&quot; This brother and sister didn't advertise the fact that they were related, and went by different last names. As you know, Casey tells us all about it.\n\nCasey explains how the band Quarterflash got its name, and what the phrase &quot;Young Turks&quot; means.\n\nIn the history of the chart (so far) there have been 8 songs that identify a woman with a particular place (such as &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot; or &quot;The Little Old Lady From Pasadena&quot;). The 9th is in this countdown.\n\nThe Four Tops are on the chart for the first time since 1973 with their song &quot;When She Was My Girl&quot; (at number 11).\n\nA listener wants to know if any top 40 song titles name any professional athletes. Casey says there have been two songs about boxers.\n\n40: Don't Stop Believing - Journey\n39: The Sweetest Thing - Juice Newton\n38: Promises In The Dark - Pat Benatar\n37: Take My Heart - Kool &amp; The Gang\n36: No Reply At All- Genesis\n35: Our Lips Are Sealed - The Go-Go's\n34: My Girl - Chillawack\n33: Harden My Heart - Quarterflash\nLDD: The One That You Love - Air Supply\n32: Stop Draggin' My Heart Around - Stevie Nicks W/ Tom Petty\nARCHIVES: Love Theme From &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; - Henry Mancini\n31: Leather And Lace - Stevie Nicks w/ Don Henley\n30: Trouble - Lindsey Buckingham\n29: Let's Groove - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n28: Sausalito Summernight - Diesel\n27: Atlanta Lady - Marty Balin\n26: She's A Bad Mama Jama - Carl Carlton\n25: Young Turks - Rod Stewart\n24: Super Freak - Rick James\n23: Share Your Love With Me - Kenny Rogers\n22: Step By Step - Eddie Rabbitt\n21: Why Do Fools Fall In Love - Diana Ross\nARCHIVES:  In The Year 2525 - Zager &amp; Evans\n20: The Old Songs - Barry Manilow\n19: Every Little Think She Does Is Magic - The Police\n18: Just Once - Quincy Jones w/ James Ingram\n17: Say Goodbye To Hollywood - Billy Joel\n16: Oh No - The Commodores\n15: We're In This Love Together - Al Jarreau\n14: Physical - Olivia Newton-John\n13: Endless Love - Diana Ross &amp; Lionel Richie\nLDD: Every Time I Think Of You - The Babys\n12: Theme From &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; - Mike Post\nArchives: Honky Tonk Woman - The Rolling Stones\n11: When She Was My Girl - The Four Tops\n10: Waiting For A Girl Like You - Foreigner\n9: Here I Am - Air Supply\n8: I've Done Everything For You - Rick Springfield\n7: Hard To Say - Dan Fogelberg\n6: The Night Owls - Little River Band\n5: Tryin' To Live My Life Without You - Bob Seger\n4: For Your Eyes Only - Sheena Easton\n3: Arthur's Theme - Christopher Cross\n2: Start Me Up - Rolling Stones\n1: Private Eyes - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abb991d3b4865d1e26db882af0b67f56458e1a76","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1981_November_7th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abb991d3b4865d1e26db882af0b67f56458e1a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,185,145,211,180,134,93,30,38,219,136,42,240,182,127,86,69,142,26,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
