In this album, Dio is listed by his birth name Ronald Padavona. He later explained in an interview in 1994 that he was already using Dio as his stage name years before this album, but he used his birth name on this album as a tribute to his parents so that they could see their family name on an album at least once.\n\n   After this album, Steve Edwards replaced David Feinstein on guitar, and Craig Gruber took over bass duties, leaving Ronnie James Dio solely as the lead singer. This future lineup, minus Edwards, became the first incarnation of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow when guitarist Ritchie Blackmore formed it after leaving Deep Purple.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArtist...............: Elf\n\nAlbum................: Elf ( Debut Album )\n\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1972\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; HP CDDVDW TS-L633R\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\n\nInformation..........: RARE and Out Of Print\n\nRipped by............: CAPTAiN_24 on 13/05/2012\nPosted by............: CAPTAiN_24 on 20/05/2012\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............:\nCovers...............: Front, Back &amp; CD\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
