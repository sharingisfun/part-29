It is based on a 1949 exorcism\nBlatty heard about while he was a student in the class of 1950 at Georgetown University, a\nJesuit and Catholic school. The exorcism was partially performed in both Mount Rainier,\nMaryland and Bel-Nor, Missouri. Several area newspapers reported on a speech a priest\ngave to an amateur parapsychology society, in which he claimed to have exorcised a demon\nfrom a thirteen-year-old boy named Robbie, and that the ordeal lasted a little more than six\nweeks, ending on April 19, 1949.\n\n\nPlot\n\nAn elderly Jesuit priest named Father Lankester Merrin is leading an archaeological dig in\nnorthern Iraq and studying ancient relics. Following the discovery of a small statue of the\ndemon Pazuzu (an actual ancient Sumerian demigod) and a modern-day St. Christopher\nmedal curiously juxtaposed together at the site, a series of omens alerts him to a pending\nconfrontation with a powerful evil, which unknown to the reader at this point, he has battled\nbefore in an exorcism in Africa. Meanwhile in Georgetown, a young girl named Regan\nMacNeil living with her famous actress mother, Chris MacNeil, becomes inexplicably ill. After\na gradual series of poltergeist-like disturbances, she undergoes disturbing psychological and\nphysical changes, appearing to become &quot;possessed&quot; by a demonic spirit.\n\n\n\nGeneral #0\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\nCodec ID : mp42\nFile size : 700 MiB\nPlayTime : 1h 48mn\nOverall bit rate : 824 Kbps\n\nVideo #0\n\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 512 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.084\nStandard : PAL\n\nAudio #0\n\nCodec : AAC\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 162 Kbps\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : English\n\n\nDVD @600/dpi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae9a79c2f95e79beb1a1c47b17ebe70498bffc80","amp;dn":"The+Exorcist+%281973%29+%5BH.264-MP4%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae9a79c2f95e79beb1a1c47b17ebe70498bffc80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,154,121,194,249,94,121,190,177,161,196,123,23,235,231,4,152,191,252,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
