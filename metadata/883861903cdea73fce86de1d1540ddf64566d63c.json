The four-song EP &quot;DISSENSION&quot; was recorded and released in late 2012, and the band lineup solidified not long after with the addition of guitarist Josh Mason (THRONE OF WILDERNESS, NAZGUL, ex-NEOTHEIST), drummer Bill Rotach and bassist Joe Rotach (both of DESEKRATOR). Aggressive yet melodic and thought-provoking, HALOTHANE unleashes a twin lead guitar assault over a hard-hitting, precision rhythm section and moody atmospherics. HALOTHANE is currently writing new material for a tentative mid-2014 release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:883861903cdea73fce86de1d1540ddf64566d63c","amp;dn":"Halothane+-+Dissension+EP+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"883861903cdea73fce86de1d1540ddf64566d63c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,56,97,144,60,222,167,63,206,134,222,29,21,64,221,246,69,102,214,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
