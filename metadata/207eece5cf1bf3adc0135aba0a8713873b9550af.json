The artists seem to have attempted to erase the evidence of its existence. These are not the original MP3 files that were once on Bandcamp, but I managed to pull them from an embedded Soundcloud widget off the band page. It is as close as we can get unless someone provides the original files one day...\r\n\r\n\r\n- Information -\r\nArtist : GASHCAT\r\nAlbum : Reunion!
