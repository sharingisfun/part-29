Bennett\n\n\nPublisher:   Springer\nNumber Of Pages:   200\nPublication Date:   2010-10-01\nISBN-10 / ASIN:   1441966846\nISBN-13 / EAN:   9781441966841\n\n\nProduct Description:\n\nFederal patronage of science was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, but they did seek to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpromote the Progress of Science and useful ArtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by granting inventors patent rights. However, direct subvention to scientists and scientific organizations was not considered appropriate activity of the central government. In the 19th Century, American science was funded almost entirely through private investors. Since WWII, however, the federal government has become the primary patron of American science. From the race-to-space in the 1950s to current furor over global warming, Bennett traces the subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which government has co-opted scientific research and reinforced a culture in which challengers to proscribed wisdom are frozen out. Citing original documents and media reports, Bennett offers a compelling, entertaining, and thought-provoking perspective on political influence on scientific research and its implications for a democratic society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0952895295345fcf093d4f4506749bc7051d7f2a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+The+Doomsday+Lobby+Hype+and+Panic+from+Sputniks%2C+Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0952895295345fcf093d4f4506749bc7051d7f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,82,137,82,149,52,95,207,9,61,79,69,6,116,155,199,5,29,127,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
