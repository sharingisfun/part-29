LaChapelle wanted the video to have a &quot;documentary&quot;-style look, much like that of his 2005 film Rize, of which five of the dancers from the &quot;Hung Up&quot; video appeared. LaChapelle and Madonna disagreed on the concept, prompting the project to be reassigned to Johan Renck. According to an interview with MTV, Renck was directing Kate Moss for a H&amp;M commercial whence he received a phone call from Madonna who desperately wanted to work with him. The next day he went to Los Angeles to meet the stylist and the choreographer hired by Madonna, who mailed him with her ideas for the video.\n\n    &quot;I kind of liked that we didn't have time to over-think this and be too clever, [..] I like being out on a limb and not know what we're doing and why. Just deal with it, the mayhem, you know?&quot; - Johan Renck\n\nMadonna wanted to use a few performers from her tour, such as Daniel &quot;Cloud&quot; Campos, Miss Prissy from LaChapelle's &quot;Rize&quot; crew and traceur Sebastien Foucan, a practitioner of parkour, a philosophical French sport that involves moving via uninterrupted motion, whether over, under, through or around objects. Renck said that &quot;It's not about the music, but the bodily expression, [...] We wanted to show the whole spectrum, be it krumping, breakdancing, jazz or disco.&quot; Since they could not shoot all over the world, Madonna wanted the video to have an &quot;omnipresent feel&quot;, with the middle section of the song generating a sense of congregation. Renck suggested that they include a boombox, used as a means of uniting everyone and everything since it was through listening to songs on a boombox that street dancing started. Though some scenes in the video feature cities like London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Tokyo, in reality the actual sets were constructed in Los Angeles and London only. A London suburb was made to look like a Parisian one, where the routine for parkour takes place, whereas a restaurant in London's Chinatown was used for the Shanghai sequence and Compton stood in for Bronx. The dancers' scenes were shot in early October 2005 within half a day, for a total of six days of shooting.\n\nMadonna clarified that the video was a tribute to John Travolta and to dance in general. Her dance moves for the video, which were inspired by Travolta's movies like Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978) and Perfect (1985) took three hours to shoot. Madonna had broken eight bones in a horseback-riding accident a few weeks before shooting the video. Hence she faced difficulty doing the steps as devised by choreographer Jamie King. Renck said,\n\n    &quot;She was such a trooper, [...] She just fell off a horse! [Madonna said]'If you were a real dance choreographer, you could tell I can't lift my left arm higher than this' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and it was like, what, a 20-centimeter difference? [...] But when she said it 'hurts like f---,' she'd take a break and sit down for two minutes. [Madonna]'I have broken ribs, remember that!' I just can't imagine dancing like that. Talk about priorities.&quot;\n\nMadonna was also associated with the editing process of the video. She was Renck's editing supervisor. Madonna wanted a raw documentary look for the video which allowed her to be portrayed more realistically. Regarding the making of &quot;Hung Up&quot;, Renck said that it was a massive work to undertake, &quot;It's like you form this little family that's flourished and prospered for the month, and then you chop it down like a tree, [...] You come out with a sense of yearning and longing, like, 'Can we just do that again? Please?'&quot; The video starts with Madonna coming to a ballet studio carrying a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges with a group of people on the street who start dancing to the music while listening to a similar boombox. They also display the physical discipline parkour, while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while the people from the street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in a Chinese restaurant and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and comes out on the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts. Madonna is shown mingling with some dancers on a dance floor and riding on a boombox. As the song starts again, Madonna and the people from the street, who act as her background dancers, all dance on a Dance Dance Revolution machine in a gaming parlor. The video ends showing Madonna lying on the ballet studio floor.\n\nThe video was nominated for five awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video, Dance Video, Pop Video, Best Choreography and the Video of the Year award although it did not win any of them.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ff381ee14fa3ec1d5484be93989639b07c88ca","amp;dn":"Madonna+-+Hung+Up++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ff381ee14fa3ec1d5484be93989639b07c88ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,255,56,30,225,79,163,236,29,84,132,190,147,152,150,57,176,124,136,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
