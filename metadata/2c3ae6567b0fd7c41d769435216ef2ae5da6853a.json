L. Hanna High School football coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) and a mentally challenged young man James Robert &quot;Radio&quot; Kennedy (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). Also starring Debra Winger and Alfre Woodard, it was inspired by the 1996 Sports Illustrated article &quot;Someone to Lean On&quot; by Gary Smith.[1] This movie was filmed primarily in Walterboro, South Carolina, because its buildings and downtown areas still fit the look of the era the film depicted.\n\nThe film's lead character, Radio, is based upon James Robert Kennedy (born October 14, 1946 in Anderson, South Carolina, USA). Kennedy grew up fascinated by radios. His nickname, Radio, was given to him by townspeople because of the radio he carried everywhere he went. He still attends T. L. Hanna High School and helps coach the football team and the basketball team. He is known to ask students before football games, &quot;We gonna get that quarterback?&quot;, and say &quot;We gonna win tonight!&quot; .[citation needed] ReelSports provided the football and basketball coordination for the film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c3ae6567b0fd7c41d769435216ef2ae5da6853a","amp;dn":"Radio+%5B2003%5D+DVD5+PAL+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c3ae6567b0fd7c41d769435216ef2ae5da6853a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,58,230,86,123,15,215,196,29,118,148,53,33,110,242,174,93,166,133,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
