Among non-jazz fans, &quot;Satchmo&quot; is best known for singing ballads like &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;.\n\nLouis Armstrong was born in New Orleans in 1901. By the mid-20s he had moved to Chicago and was recording seminal jazz standards such as &quot;Weatherbird&quot;, &quot;Muggles&quot; and &quot;West End Blues&quot;. His trumpet improvisations on records such as these led to jazz shifting from a musical style that involved many musicians playing a set tune together to a form that concentrated on solo improvisation. He also helped to popularise the vocal style known as scat singing, which in turn had a profound effect on young singers like Bing Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald. Among mainstream audiences he is most famous for hit songs such as &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, &quot;Hello Dolly&quot; and &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot;.\n\nLouis Armstrong died of a heart attack on July 6, 1971; he was 69. Exactly 100 years after the day he was born, New Orleans airport was renamed Louis Armstrong International Airport\n\n\n\n_________________________\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1 \tThat's My Home \t                             3:11 \t\n  \tMedley Of Armstrong Hits                    (4:25)\n2A \t\tI'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You \t\t\n2B \t\tWhen It's Sleepy Time Down South \t\t\n2C \t\tNobody's Sweetheart \t\t\n3 \tI've Got The World On A String \t             3:15 \t\n4 \tI've Got A Right To Sing The Blues \t     3:01 \t\n5 \tHigh Society \t                             3:24 \t\n6 \tBasin Street Blues \t                     3:25 \t\n7 \tMahogany Hall Stomp \t                     2:35 \t\n8 \tSt. Louis Blues \t                     2:41 \t\n9 \tBlue Yodel Number 9 \t                     2:34 \t\n10 \tLong, Long Journey \t                     4:30 \t\n11 \tBack O' Town Blues \t                     3:15 \t\n12 \tSugar \t                                     3:24 \t\n13 \tDo You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans? \t2:59 \t\n14 \tAin't Misbehavin' \t                     3:55 \t\n15 \tRockin' Chair \t                            5:15 \t\n16 \tJack-Armstrong Blues \t                    2:59\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Louis-Armstrong-The-Best-Of-The-Complete-RCA-Victor-Recordings/release/1448121&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Louis-Armstrong-The-Best-Of-The-Complete-RCA-Victor-Recordings/release/1448121&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n16 Tracks  @320 kbps\n\nRipped and Encoded Personally\n\nEnjoy and Seed\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7af38d7bdf367e4af58e2601984fd0897da70c1e","amp;dn":"Louis+Armstrong+-+The+Best+Of+The+Complete+RCA+Victor+Recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7af38d7bdf367e4af58e2601984fd0897da70c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,243,141,123,223,54,126,74,245,142,38,1,152,79,208,137,125,167,12,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
