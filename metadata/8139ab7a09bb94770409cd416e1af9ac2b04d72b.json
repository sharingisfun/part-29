This is one of the newest products of Chaos Group. The software perfectly combines a grid based simulator with outstanding rendering capabilities. In addition to the usual uniform fluid behavior, Phoenix FD is capable of simulating a whole array of additional processes like pressure decay, thermal radiation cooling and mass-temperature dependence.\nNew features:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extension for liquid simulations\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Turbulence helper\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Forward transfer advection\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Randomization\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Analytic scattering mode\n\nModified features:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added ramps and ranges in the viewport\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ability to use the radius of the PF particles in the source helper\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Color ramp and preview range for each channel\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ RGB preview of the UVW channel\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Limits for the adaptive grid\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Optimized the interaction with the scene\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Option to displace without surface projection, using directly the 3d point coordinates (volumetric displacement).\n\nBugs fixed:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Problem with the solid sources when the temperature channel is not active\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Crash when a body exits from an adaptive grid\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The fluid can pass through a thin object\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ When Phoenix FD is installed the CAT canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t add fingers\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The vorticity does not affect certain areas in the simulation, especially the leading front of the flow.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The GPU preview continues to update even when the window is invisible (performance bug).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Crash when displacement is used in solid mode and the surface crosses the upper boundary\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Phoenix texture does not sample UVW and velocity channels if the node is not rendered\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The rendering hangs when the cell size is too small\n\nHOME http://www.chaosgroup.com/en/2/phoenix.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8139ab7a09bb94770409cd416e1af9ac2b04d72b","amp;dn":"Phoenix+FD+1.20.00+For+3D+Studx+2012+32Bit+%2F+64Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8139ab7a09bb94770409cd416e1af9ac2b04d72b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,57,171,122,9,187,148,119,4,9,205,65,110,26,249,172,43,4,215,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
