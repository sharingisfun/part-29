A former Columbia Professor and self-proclaimed genius who came close to winning a Nobel Prize for Quantum Mechanics, Boris fancies himself the only one who fully comprehends the meaningless of all human aspirations, and the pitch-black chaos of the universe. As he readily admits, Boris is not a feel-good person.\n\nLarry David, Evan Rachel Wood, Patricia Clarkson, Ed Begley Jr, Michael McKean\n\nDirected by: Woody Allen\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&lt;/a&gt;\n                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmiTheGreek&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmiTheGreek&lt;/a&gt;\n\n!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fed46d1a2392af488686e15b761850729ee4dff","amp;dn":"Whatever+Works+%282009%29+-+DvDrip+-+Hard+Greek+Subs+-+Omifast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fed46d1a2392af488686e15b761850729ee4dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,237,70,209,162,57,42,244,136,104,110,21,183,97,133,7,41,238,77,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
