Starting with Young&amp;#039;s work in Buffalo Springfield, some of the nuggets include the psychedelic calliope that is &quot;Down To The Wire&quot; and the fuzz guitar/Motown-inspired &quot;Mr. Soul.&quot; Throughout these ten years of recordings, Young constantly dug deep, touching on controversial topics be it his CSN&amp;Y masterpiece about the student massacre at Kent State (&quot;Ohio&quot;), compositions dealing with the ups and downs of the drug culture (&quot;Needle And The Damage Done,&quot; &quot;Tonight&amp;#039;s The Night&quot;) or history&amp;#039;s dark chapters of racial injustice (&quot;Cortez The Killer,&quot; &quot;Southern Man&quot;).\n\nNeil Young&amp;#039;s choice of accompanists also allowed him to explore many different avenues. Crazy Horse provided the sonic wallop that bore such fruit as &quot;Like A Hurricane,&quot; whereas The Stray Gators provided the springboard for more countrycentric numbers like &quot;Heart Of Gold&quot; and &quot;Harvest.&quot; Other welcome inclusions are &quot;Star Of Bethlehem&quot; and &quot;Deep Forbidden Lake,&quot; from HOMEGROWN, the unreleased sequel to HARVEST. The solid material on this compilation and accompanying liner notes by Neil Young make this an essential part of any record collection.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc one\n\n1. &quot;Down to the Wire&quot; ? 2:25 Performed by Buffalo Springfield &amp; Dr. John, from the unreleased Buffalo Springfield album Stampede.\n2. &quot;Burned&quot; ? 2:14 Performed by Buffalo Springfield, the first Neil Young vocal ever recorded, circa late 1966.\n3. &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; ? 2:41 Performed by Buffalo Springfield, recorded live in the studio in New York City.\n4. &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; ? 6:13 Performed by Buffalo Springfield.\n5. &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot; ? 3:44 Performed by Buffalo Springfield.\n6. &quot;Sugar Mountain&quot; ? 5:43 Recorded live in concert on November 9, 1968 at the Canterbury House, Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n7. &quot;I Am a Child&quot; ? 2:17 Performed by Buffalo Springfield.\n8. &quot;The Loner&quot; ? 3:50\n9. &quot;The Old Laughing Lady&quot; ? 5:35\n10. &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; ? 2:59\n11. &quot;Down by the River&quot; ? 8:58\n12. &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; ? 10:01\n13. &quot;I Believe in You&quot; ? 3:27\n14. &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; ? 3:45\n15. &quot;Southern Man&quot; ? 5:31\n16. &quot;Helpless&quot; ? 3:34 Performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Youn\n\nDisc two\n\n1. &quot;Ohio&quot; ? 2:56 Performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\n2. &quot;Soldier&quot; ? 2:28\n3. &quot;Old Man&quot; ? 3:21\n4. &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; ? 3:58\n5. &quot;Harvest&quot; ? 3:08\n6. &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; ? 3:06\n7. &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot; ? 2:46\n8. &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; ? 2:02\n9. &quot;Tonight&amp;#039;s the Night, Part 1&quot; ? 4:41\n10. &quot;Tired Eyes&quot; ? 4:33\n11. &quot;Walk On&quot; ? 2:40\n12. &quot;For the Turnstiles&quot; ? 3:01\n13. &quot;Winterlong&quot; ? 3:05 previously unreleased\n14. &quot;Deep Forbidden Lake&quot; ? 3:39 previously unreleased\n15. &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; ? 8:16\n16. &quot;Love is a Rose&quot; ? 2:16 previously unreleased\n17. &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot; ? 7:29\n18. &quot;Campaigner&quot; ? 3:30 previously unreleased\n19. &quot;Long May You Run&quot; ? 3:48 original CSNY cut\n\n\nScans have not been descreened","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c913758606ca3df79d3d6f44bf2c49121e7eec14","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+Decade+%281977%29+%5BVBR+w%2FScans%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c913758606ca3df79d3d6f44bf2c49121e7eec14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,19,117,134,6,202,61,247,157,61,111,68,191,44,73,18,30,126,236,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
