Those hoping for a big bang to finish will also be disappointed but the band have traditionally closed with a mid-paced jammer, and &quot;Rowing&quot; plays to type. This is actually their shortest album since 1988 debut &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; but without some of the rockier numbers in there later on this requires a patient and dedicated listen. Worry not, though, the substance is there and it hardly takes a scholar to pick it out.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Been away too long                                   [03:36]\n02.Non-State actor                                      [03:57]\n03.By crooked steps                                     [04:01]\n04.A thousand days before                               [04:23]\n05.Blood on the valley floor                            [03:49]\n06.Bones of birds                                       [04:23]\n07.Taree                                                [03:38]\n08.Attrition                                            [02:53]\n09.Black saturday                                       [03:30]\n10.Halfway there                                        [03:16]\n11.Worse dreams                                         [04:53]\n12.Eyelid's mouth                                       [04:39]\n13.Rowing                                               [05:09]\n14.Worse dreams [demo]                                  [03:21]\n15.Black saturday [demo]                                [03:16]\n16.By crooked steps [demo]                              [04:23]\n________\n63:07 min\n 98,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
