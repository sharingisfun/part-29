Starting with her misspent youth in the bar car of a regional railroad, where at fifteen she told commutersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fortunes in exchange for beer, and continuing today as she slings cocktails at a neighborhood joint in Brooklyn, Schaap has learned her way around both sides of a bar and come to realize how powerful the fellowship among regular patrons can be.\n\nIn Drinking with Men, Schaap shares her unending quest for the perfect local haunt, which takes her from a dive outside Los Angeles to a Dublin pub full of poets, and from small-town New England taverns to a character-filled bar in ManhattanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TriBeCa. Drinking alongside artists and expats, ironworkers and soccer fanatics, she finds these places offer a safe haven, a respite, and a place to feel most like herself. In rich, colorful prose, Schaap brings to life these seedy, warm, and wonderful rooms. Drinking with Men is a love letter to the bars, pubs, and taverns that have been SchaapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refuge, and a celebration of the uniquely civilizing source of community that is bar culture at its best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9798fd86bbc519ecd3b058954cb5b25cc3f7169","amp;dn":"Drinking+With+Men+-+Rosie+Schaap.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9798fd86bbc519ecd3b058954cb5b25cc3f7169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,121,143,216,107,188,81,158,205,59,5,137,84,203,91,37,204,63,113,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
