It is uploaded on the coursera. This is the best course online and I would recommend going over this course content and doing the assignments and quizzes and also solving the Final Exam. \nCOntains both the theoretical foundation of Computer science along with the practical programming skill that you would need in a job. Building your own desktop application as well data structures.\n\nThis course is the best. Do not pay the fees at Udemey or edxcl, when you can learn the best thing from a reputed university professors and that too for free. \n\n\nI will add the final exams, Assignment problems soon.
