With pianist Tommy Flanagan, guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Keter Betts, and drummer Bobby Durham serving as a backup group (not a bad band), she swings everything from &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; and &quot;It Don't Mean a Thing&quot; to &quot;Lemon Drop&quot; and even Carole King's &quot;You've Got a Friend.&quot; Her ballad interpretations are only topped by her scatting talents. This set serves as a perfect introduction to the mature Ella Fitzgerald. \n\n01. Sweet Georgia Brown    \n02. They Can't Take That Away From Me  \n03. Everytime We Say Goodbye   \n04. The Man I Love    \n05. It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)  \n06. You've Got A Friend    \n07. Lemon Drop   \n08. The Very Thought Of You   \n09. Happy Blues\n\n   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3d27d38b10f85cd7a80ecc13083ae417fb0f7a6","amp;dn":"Ella+Fitzgerald+-+Ella+In+London+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3d27d38b10f85cd7a80ecc13083ae417fb0f7a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,210,125,56,177,15,133,205,122,128,236,193,48,131,174,65,127,176,247,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
