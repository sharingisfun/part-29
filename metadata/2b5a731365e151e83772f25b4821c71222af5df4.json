With the help of a priest, a coroner, and one beautiful lawyer, Northern must uncover the facts in a place legendary for keeping its secrets. There are forces at work in The Holy See that would see the truth remain hidden-forces ancient and dark, with a power not seen in this world for millennia, and an agenda that will leave Northern's world more shattered than he could have ever foreseen.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b5a731365e151e83772f25b4821c71222af5df4","amp;dn":"Revelations+%28Dark+Horse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b5a731365e151e83772f25b4821c71222af5df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,90,115,19,101,225,81,232,55,114,242,91,72,33,199,18,34,175,93,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
