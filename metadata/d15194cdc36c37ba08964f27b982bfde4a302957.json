Although the pianist is virtually always the lead voice, Brown and Thigpen both make strong (if subtle) contributions to the music. Highlights include &quot;Liza,&quot; &quot;Con Alma,&quot; &quot;Waltz for Debby,&quot; Brown's &quot;The Gravy Waltz&quot; and &quot;Yours Is My Heart Alone.&quot; An above-average release (and rather generous at 74 minutes) from the much recorded Oscar Peterson. \n\nTracks 1-6 are 'The Jazz Soul Of Oscar Peterson'.\nTracks 7-14 are 'Affinity'.\n\n01.
