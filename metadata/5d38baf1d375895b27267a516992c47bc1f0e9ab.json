This is an album in the classic sense, a wide spectrum journey one takes knowing steady hands will stir one through the shifting currents. Co-produced by Jeremy Black (Apollo Sunshine) at Oakland's increasingly hot Coyote Hearing Studio, In The Wake wriggles and glows with life, a chronicle of survivors thriving through myriad challenges, the bubbling product of a rugged, dented determination to seek beauty and truth in a song.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d38baf1d375895b27267a516992c47bc1f0e9ab","amp;dn":"Tea+Leaf+Green+-+In+The+Wake+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d38baf1d375895b27267a516992c47bc1f0e9ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,56,186,241,211,117,137,91,39,38,122,81,105,146,196,123,193,240,233,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
