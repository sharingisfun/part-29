Developments in physics, biology and the neurosciences have reinvigorated discussions about the nature of life and ultimate reality. At the same time, the growth of anti-evolutionary and intelligent design movements has led many to the view that science and religion are necessarily in conflict. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the relations between science and religion, with contributions from historians, philosophers, scientists and theologians. It explores the impact of religion on the origins and development of science, religious reactions to Darwinism, and the link between science and secularization. It also offers in-depth discussions of contemporary issues, with perspectives from cosmology, evolutionary biology, psychology, and bioethics. The volume is rounded out with philosophical reflections on the connections between atheism and science, the nature of scientific and religious knowledge, and divine action and human freedom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:372b930c4f3e7ce37c9955afb6b23d1792e04bf8","amp;dn":"+Cambridge+Companion+Science+and+Religion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"372b930c4f3e7ce37c9955afb6b23d1792e04bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,43,147,12,79,62,124,227,124,153,85,175,182,178,61,23,146,224,75,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
