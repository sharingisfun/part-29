A brave war party stands as guardians of the helpless villagers, but they are no match for the horrors rising up around them. One of the warriors, a young hero named Rikard, will pay the ultimate price in battle Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ but his fight is far from over. A gothic horror story of witchcraft, night creatures, and the undead.\n\n\n*** Enjoy and Please SEED ***\n\n\nThere are way too many great uploaders to list anymore :) Search TPB Comics and you'll find almost anything you want.
