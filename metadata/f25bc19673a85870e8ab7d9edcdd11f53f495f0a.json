The Commissar had the biggest secret of the Russian war. He had hidden 30 million dollars of Soviet gold behind Russian lines - and Porta was determined to make sure his band of prison-soldiers got their share. For enemy gold they were prepared to take the company through the ice and blood of the Soviet lines, prepared to kill or be killed, prepared to fight like animals and cheat, lie, and steal like the criminals they had become. The lure of gold, the promises of the Commissar, were to carry them into the bloodiest battles of the Russian war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f25bc19673a85870e8ab7d9edcdd11f53f495f0a","amp;dn":"The+Commissar+-+Hassel+Sven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f25bc19673a85870e8ab7d9edcdd11f53f495f0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,91,193,150,115,168,88,112,232,171,125,158,220,221,17,245,63,73,95,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
