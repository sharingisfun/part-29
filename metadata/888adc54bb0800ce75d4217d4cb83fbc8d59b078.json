Lind describes how successive American statesmen--from George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton to Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan--have pursued an American way of strategy that minimizes the dangers of empire and anarchy by two means: liberal internationalism and realism. At its best, the American way of strategy is a well-thought-out and practical guide designed to preserve a peaceful and demilitarized world by preventing an international system dominated by imperial and militarist states and its disruption by anarchy. When American leaders have followed this path, they have led our nation from success to success, and when they have deviated from it, the results have been disastrous. Framed in an engaging historical narrative, the book makes an important contribution to contemporary debates. The American Way of Strategy is certain to change the way that Americans understand U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\n# Paperback: 304 pages\n# Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA (July 30, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0195341414\n# ISBN-13: 978-0195341416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888adc54bb0800ce75d4217d4cb83fbc8d59b078","amp;dn":"The+American+Way+of+Strategy+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888adc54bb0800ce75d4217d4cb83fbc8d59b078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,138,220,84,187,8,0,206,117,212,33,125,76,184,63,188,141,89,176,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
