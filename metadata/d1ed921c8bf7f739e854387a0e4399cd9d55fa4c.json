It was released on their independent label, Rite-Off Records, in February 1995 and sold over 10,000 units before being picked up by the national label Polydor/Atlas after the band signed with that label later in 1995. The album was re-released nationally with no further production enhancement in October 1995 and went on the spawn three national hits - &quot;Fear of Falling&quot;, &quot;Angeline Is Coming Home&quot;, and &quot;Gwendolyn&quot;.\n\nRiver Songs may be a bit top-heavy due to sheer quality of the opening numbers, but front-to-back there are no weak songs on this album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angels of MercyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“BendinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the RulesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are excellent melodic rock with a message brought by intelligent lyrics and a touch of sarcastic humor, with Ã¢â‚¬Å“BendinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the RulesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ also containing some strong guitars and a reprise with a harder edge. Due to the excellent singing efforts of  Pete Palladino combined with the music tinged with a touch of blues and country, you will find yourself comparing the sound of this band as similar to the sound of Hootie and The Blowfish.  It will certainly not be the first time the two bands have been confused by this album for the listener.\n\nTrack\tTitle\t\t\t\t\t\tLength\n1. \tAngeline Is Coming Home\t\t\t\t4:09\t\n2. \tFear Of Falling\t\t\t\t\t4:50\t\n3. \tAngels Of Mercy\t\t\t\t\t4:11\t\n4. \tGrill The Sucker\t\t\t\t1:12\t \n5. \tQueen Of Perfection\t\t\t\t3:03\t\n6. \tBendin' The Rules\t\t\t\t6:10\t \n7. \tGwendolyn\t\t\t\t\t4:20\n8. \tOre Hill\t \t\t\t\t5:55\t\n9. \tNothing Much Of Anything\t\t\t3:35\t \n10. \tSong For A River\t\t\t\t8:17\t\n11.\tI Liked You Better When You Hated Yourself\t2:45\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1ed921c8bf7f739e854387a0e4399cd9d55fa4c","amp;dn":"The+Badlees+-+River+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1ed921c8bf7f739e854387a0e4399cd9d55fa4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,237,146,28,139,247,247,57,232,84,56,122,14,67,153,205,157,85,250,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
