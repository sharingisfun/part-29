It was a totally revolutionary concept. Get a narrator to tell a summarized story, generally adapted from a novel but do so from start to finish through the course of around 2 hours - the sets are shorter as they don't contain the ads. Now, add to that a DJ (enter Oakie) who creates a soundscape to set the mood of the story. The music used is often dance orientated, but also contains many other genres as needed by the part of the story.\n\nBe aware that the sound quality on some of these is pretty low. They have NEVER been available to buy, and these are all recorded through various means. I am led to believe that more than one of these was originally recorded to VHS (the only common medium at the time that would record the whole show without missing anything) and eventually dubbed back to a PC recording. Nevertheless, even the ones with poor quality sound bad for a few minutes, then you are immersed into the story and completely miss the poor sound quality for the rest of the show. The files are generally variable bitrate, but the medium seems about 160-192. The total time is over 59 hours!\n\nThis set is missing one episode, which for the life of me I haven't been able to find. The closest was a number of copies of a partial file, so if someone does have E34 - Beauty and the Beast, please for the love of all that is fluffy and cute, do drop a link or post a torrent.\n\nPaul Oakenfold - Urban Soundtrack - E01 - Filth (Feat.
