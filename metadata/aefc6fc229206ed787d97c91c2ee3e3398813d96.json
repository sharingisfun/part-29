For example, Brinstar is a bit more than 5:00, but Windows Media Player says it is 3:06.)\n\nAbout 33.4MB total\n\n*Since I'm so awesome, I didn't pack these in a .RAR, so you can choose what you want downloaded.\n\n\n\n*****SEED OR DIE*****\n\n\nCheck this torrent out for more awesome metal remixes:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3830439/powerglove_2_albums\n*The Tetris theme I included is from Powerglove, which I just learned.*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aefc6fc229206ed787d97c91c2ee3e3398813d96","amp;dn":"Video+Game+Metal+Remixes+%28Nintendo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aefc6fc229206ed787d97c91c2ee3e3398813d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,252,111,194,41,32,110,215,135,217,124,145,194,238,62,51,152,129,61,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
