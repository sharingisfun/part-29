However, because she hosts a RissÃ¢â‚¬â€an intelligent parasiteÃ¢â‚¬â€she continues to be seen by many as an alien, generating disgust, fear, raw hate, and attempts on her life.\nTo add to her problems, the Raiders have identified her as contributing directly to their bad luck in fighting against the SAS Navy. They consider her a dybbukÃ¢â‚¬â€a demonÃ¢â‚¬â€and have set a price on herÃ¢â‚¬â€dead or alive.\nNadya alone has deduced the Raiders arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a bunch of independent criminals, but clans with their own planet, and with spies on SAS planets and naval cruisers. She needs to convince the SAS, find the clansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ planetÃ¢â‚¬â€and stay alive. Her life has become very complicated. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.mobilism.org/?dm=AP3J&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.mobilism.org/?dm=AP3J&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a145ee2808a5d56d0b41e1b0129e9c7ba8a0e27","amp;dn":"The+Riss+Proposal+by+C.R.+Daems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a145ee2808a5d56d0b41e1b0129e9c7ba8a0e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,20,94,226,128,138,93,86,208,180,30,27,1,41,233,199,186,138,14,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
