(v1.0)\n\n\nNOTE: You have to patch it yourself. Another thing, the reason an emulator isn't added is because I figured people may have one or it's an emulator they don't want. If you need one, I suggest VBA-M as its good but you may need to play with the sound.\n\nMac users, if you use VBA-M you'll need to play with SRAM because it seems to have a saving problem. Nevertheless, have fun.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f178136df911915232983e5102067b17a1788258","amp;dn":"Mother+3+%28J%29+ROM+%2B+Patch+English+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f178136df911915232983e5102067b17a1788258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,120,19,109,249,17,145,82,50,152,62,81,2,6,123,23,161,120,130,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
