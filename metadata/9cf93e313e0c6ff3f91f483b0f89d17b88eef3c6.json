Here's a brief video showing how well Bibble 5 performs on a very high-end machine. But Bibble 5's speed benefits are not just for those with 16 cpus; it's also designed to be efficient and fast on lower-powered machines, like notebooks or older desktops. \n\n=== Version and System Compatibility ===\n\nIncluded is Bibble 5.0.3 Pro for the following systems:\n\nWindows\nOSX\nFedora/OpenSUSE\nUbuntu/Debian 32-bit\nUbuntu/Debian 64-bit\n\nSee http://www.bibblelabs.com/ for info about Bibble.\n\n=== Crack ===\n\nAlso includes a keygen that I've verified for Ubuntu/Debian 64-bit and Windows. Should also work for the other systems, please leave a comment below if it worked/didn't work for you.\n\nNOTE FOR NON-WINDOWS-USERS: The keygen only *runs* under Windows. That doesn't mean that the *generated serials* won't work for other systems. For your convenience, I've included some ready-generated serials in the README.txt file.\n\n=== Credits ===\n\nCred to CORE for the keygen.\n\nPlease, buy the program when you've finished evaulating Bibble. It's the best RAW converter around, certainly gives Lightroom a run for its money. Let's keep Bibble Labs alive and make sure that they can release 5.1 soon.\n\nEnjoy, and please leave a comment if this was helpful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf93e313e0c6ff3f91f483b0f89d17b88eef3c6","amp;dn":"Bibble.Pro.v5.0.3.Windows%2BOSX%2BLinux.Incl.Keygen-loeffel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf93e313e0c6ff3f91f483b0f89d17b88eef3c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,249,62,49,62,12,111,243,249,31,72,59,15,137,209,123,136,238,243,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
