Familiar faces appearing in this title included Metamorpho, The Creeper and Doctor Fate. The title's final issue also launched the return of the New Gods, who branched out into an ongoing series of their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83169d63ef312e16fafa4975e219a7a79d83562e","amp;dn":"1st+Issue+Special+%2801+-+13%29+%281975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83169d63ef312e16fafa4975e219a7a79d83562e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,22,157,99,239,49,46,22,250,250,73,117,226,25,167,167,157,131,86,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
