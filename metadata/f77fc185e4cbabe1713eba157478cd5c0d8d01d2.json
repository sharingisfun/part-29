But when the island faces the sudden disappearance of 114 people now, an unlikely pair of 17-year-olds may be the only hope of bringing them back.\n\nMiranda, a misfit girl from the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most infamous family, and Phillips, an exiled teen criminal who hears the voices of the dead, must dodge everyone from federal agents to long-dead alchemists as they work to uncover the secrets of the new Lost Colony. The one thing they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dodge is each other.\n\nBlackwood is a dark, witty coming of age story that combines AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest mystery with a thoroughly contemporary romance.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77fc185e4cbabe1713eba157478cd5c0d8d01d2","amp;dn":"Blackwood+by+Gwenda+Bond+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77fc185e4cbabe1713eba157478cd5c0d8d01d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,127,193,133,228,203,171,225,113,62,186,21,116,120,205,92,13,141,1,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
