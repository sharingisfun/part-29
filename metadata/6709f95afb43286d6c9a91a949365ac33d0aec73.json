Responsible for delivering some of the heaviest pop hits of the decade, including &amp;#039;Rockstar&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;How You Remind Me&amp;#039;, Nickelback follow-up their multi-platinum selling fifth album All The Right Reasons with a hard-rocking release that is packed full of fist-pumping anthems.\n\n      Dark Horse is the product of a long-awaited pairing between Nickelback and acclaimed producer Mutt Lange. Known for his work with prolific acts such as AC/DC, Mutt Lange injects Nickelback&amp;#039;s established style with a heavy dose of crunching guitars and crashing cymbals. From the opening track, &amp;#039;Something In Your Mouth&amp;#039;, Nickelback pump-up their pseudo-metal pace with pounding power-chords and prominent lyrics. &amp;#039;Burn It To The Ground&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;This Afternoon&amp;#039; see deep-throated singer Chad Kroeger and his bandmates serve up party-animal machismo while &amp;#039;Shakin&amp;#039; Hands&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;S.E.X.&amp;#039; are thunderous sonic shenanigans that flicker with grinding riffs. While the heavy rock tracks punctuate, a series of Nickelback&amp;#039;s signature grand-gesture power ballads, including single &amp;#039;Gotta Be Somebody&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;If Today Was Your Last Day&amp;#039;, dynamically swell and stand prominent.\n\n      The hard rock formula that cemented Nickelback as one of the 21st century&amp;#039;s most successful bands remains intact throughout the album. While Mutt Lange offers snippets of the metal genre, Nickelback maintain their identity by executing their accomplished arena-rock ballads with notable passion. Every bit as catchy as their previous releases, Dark Horse is an accomplished collection of hook-laden rock songs that will ensure that Nickelback&amp;#039;s rocketing commercial success continues to soar.\n\nTrack List\t\n\n \n\n   1.
