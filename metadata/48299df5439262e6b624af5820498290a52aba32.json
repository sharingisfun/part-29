The film is set during the early 1990s. Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler nicknamed &quot;the Dude.&quot; After a case of mistaken identity the Dude is introduced to a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski. When the millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is later kidnapped he commissions the Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the full ransom. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro also star, with Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, and Tara Reid appearing in supporting roles. There is some narration at the beginning and towards the end by a cowboy known only as &quot;The Stranger,&quot; played by Sam Elliott.\n\nThe film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated: &quot;We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.&quot;[3] The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen Brothers.\n\nThe Big Lebowski was a disappointment at the U.S. box office and received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Reviews have tended towards the positive over time and the film has become a cult favorite,[4] noted for its idiosyncratic characters, dream sequences, unconventional dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.[5]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48299df5439262e6b624af5820498290a52aba32","amp;dn":"The+Big+Lebowski+%281998%29+DVD9+PAL+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48299df5439262e6b624af5820498290a52aba32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,41,157,245,67,146,98,230,182,36,175,88,32,73,130,144,165,42,186,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
