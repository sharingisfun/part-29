Designed to be undertaken over the course of 12 months under the medical supervision of GPs, the aim is steady and sustained weight loss. The first three individual programmes have been designed for: families with one or more members who need to lose weight; those who suffer diabetes-related weight problems; and women who want to lose weight pre-pregnancy in order to protect the health of their babies and themselves. \n\nWith the endorsement and ongoing supervision of GPs, Garry has developed these 12-month programmes to: provide a balanced, medically supervised approach to weight loss; involve no crash diets, tricks, fads or gimmicks; provide a programme that can be tailored to the individual needs of a client or family, taking into account their lifestyle, medical history and weight loss goals. This programme promotes a lifetime of weight management for the whole family. The media is full of news and statistics about childhood obesity, a population that is steadily becoming overweight, and the associated strains on our bodies and healthcare systems. While a genetic predisposition to increased body fat is a known factor, it is obvious that lifestyle is the main reason behind this current epidemic. Bad eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle have their origins in the home and family, and the family is where Garry sees the ultimate answer to fixing the problem. Anyone who has tried to lose weight knows that there is &quot;safety in numbers&quot; and a supportive family-based approach to and understanding of weight loss is the one most likely to succeed....................................................","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c97a6245f5e3be78b7a53bc9e55e0bb7f3b6b36d","amp;dn":"QUICK+START+WEIGHT+LOSS+PROGRAM+FOR+FAMILIES-MANTESHWER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c97a6245f5e3be78b7a53bc9e55e0bb7f3b6b36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,122,98,69,245,227,190,120,183,165,59,201,229,94,11,183,243,182,179,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
