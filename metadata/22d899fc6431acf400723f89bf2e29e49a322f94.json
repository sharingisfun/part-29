When I start watching I see a New York city in red. Then the &quot;Summer In The City&quot; song starts playing and this is a good song, but then I listen to the rest. &quot;Surfing In The Aquaduct&quot; and &quot;In Front Of The Kids&quot; are just slow, dreary rap songs which blur along. &quot;The Ants Go Marching&quot; is a mood-setter and is really good but when on a soundtrack, on it&amp;#039;s own, it starts to fall behind. In the movie it all fits in. Even Beethoven or Mozart or whoever are in there but theydon&amp;#039;t wreck it because they&amp;#039;re old. Even though the Die Hard With A Vengeance Soundtrack was a bit slow, and it only had a few good ( but old ) songs, I thought they didn&amp;#039;t need to be picked on. If they come from the movie, and they fit the movie, and the movie is good, who cares whhther it&amp;#039;s a bad soundtrack or not. Get along.\n...................................................................................\n\nnesperi \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d899fc6431acf400723f89bf2e29e49a322f94","amp;dn":"Bruce+Willis+Die+Hard+With+a+Vengeance+-+Original+Soundtrack+%2B+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d899fc6431acf400723f89bf2e29e49a322f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,216,153,252,100,49,172,244,0,114,63,137,191,46,41,228,154,50,47,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
