On board the liner Mammoth bound for New York, she runs into King Mantell (Fred MacMurray), a concertina-playing band leader with a criminal record in his past. Both are blackmailed by Robert M. Darcy (Porter Hall), and after Darcy is killed, they become two of the prime suspects for the murder, and must find the real killer before the five police detectives traveling on the ship can pin it on them.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nThe Princess Comes Across Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which began with the working title Concertina Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was initially intended to pair Lombard with George Raft for the third time, but Raft walked out when the studio assigned Ted Tetzlaff to photograph the film. Raft felt that Tetzlaff had made Lombard look better than himself in their earlier film, Rumba, and did not want it to happen again. \n\nWith Raft out of the picture, and temporarily suspended for his actions, the studio re-teamed Lombard and MacMurray, who had made the screwball comedy Hands Across the Table together in 1935. They would be paired together twice more, in 1937's Swing High, Swing Low and True Confession, made in the same year.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime  78 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 78 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03f2c18234f6b654fb541c53fa6ea5a82773d62","amp;dn":"Carole+Lombard+Collection+-+The+Princess+Comes+Across+%281936%29+Xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03f2c18234f6b654fb541c53fa6ea5a82773d62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,63,44,24,35,79,107,101,79,181,65,197,63,166,234,90,130,119,61,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
