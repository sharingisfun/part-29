They have taken her life, her freedom, and her true memories away from her. How can she reclaim anything when she doesn't know who to trust?\n\nStrong, gritty writing, irresistible psychological suspense, and action consume the novel as Jenna struggles to survive against the all-controlling ACID. Seriously sinister stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971732aa0df2a76fe0bef53ca111ccdfdf92a777","amp;dn":"ACID+-+Emma+Pass.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971732aa0df2a76fe0bef53ca111ccdfdf92a777","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,23,50,170,13,242,167,111,224,190,245,60,161,17,204,223,223,146,167,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
