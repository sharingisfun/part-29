Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\n\nGuests: Dom Irrera\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4ae18b66daae9e9ab6e09f8155e2f3811b7a5b","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23297+-+Dom+Irrera+%5B64k%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c4ae18b66daae9e9ab6e09f8155e2f3811b7a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,74,225,139,102,218,174,158,154,182,224,159,129,85,226,243,129,27,122,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
