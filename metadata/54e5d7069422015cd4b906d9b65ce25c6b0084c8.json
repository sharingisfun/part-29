This book provides a comprehensive overview of the practical aspects of multiphase reactor design and operation with an emphasis on safety and clean technology. It considers not only standard operation conditions, but also the problems of runaway reaction conditions and protection against ensuing over-pressure.\nHydrodynamics of Multiphase Reactors addresses both practical and theoretical aspects of this topic. Initial chapters discuss various different types of gas/liquid reactors from a practical viewpoint, and later chapters focus on the modelling of multiphase systems and computational methods for reactor design and problem solving. The material is written by experts in their specific fields and will include chapters on the following topics: Multiphase flow, Bubble columns, Sparged stirred vessels, Macroscale modelling, Microscale modelling, Runaway conditions, Behaviour of vessel contents, Choked flow, Measurement techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e5d7069422015cd4b906d9b65ce25c6b0084c8","amp;dn":"Hydrodynamics+of+Gas-Liquid+Reactors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e5d7069422015cd4b906d9b65ce25c6b0084c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,229,215,6,148,34,1,92,212,185,6,217,182,92,226,92,107,0,132,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
