His cronies have all traded in the mothers of their children they promised to love and cherishÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â„¢til death did them partÃ¢â‚¬â€for tanned and toned young Barbie brides.\n\nIf losing the social life and close friends she adored wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t painful enough, a series of setbacks shake LesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world and push her to the edge. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had enough of playing the good wife to a husband who thinks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing her a favor by keeping her around. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not going to waste another minute on people she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care to know. Now, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to take some time for herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€in the familiar comforts and stunning beauty of Charleston, her beloved hometown. In her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stately historic home, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to reclaim the carefree girl who spent lazy summers sharing steamy kisses with her first love on Sullivans Island. Along CharlestonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live oak- and palmetto-lined cobblestone streets, under the LowcountryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dazzling blue sky, Les will indulge herself with icy cocktails, warm laughter, divine temptation and bittersweet memories. Daring to listen to her inner voice, she will realize what she wants . . . and find the life of which sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always dreamed.\n\nTold in the alternating voices of Les and Wes, The Last Original Wife is classic Dorothea Benton Frank: an intoxicating tale of family, friendship, self-discovery, and love, that is as salty as a Lowcountry breeze and as invigorating as a dip in Carolina waters on a sizzling summer day.
