For some reason Visual Studio (2012 Ultimate) won't allow me to publish them &quot;to a file path&quot;, so I had to publish them as for CDs (with installer).\nThe projects have the code commented by me, also, for starting users to understand what's going on there. \nProjects are:\n1) &quot;Age- Cases&quot;\nConsists on showing what Cases (a type of conditionals) do in a very simple project which asks the user to put in a number and then shows a MessageBox with text.\n\n2) &quot;Conditionals&quot;\nShows how &quot;If... Then... Else... End If&quot; sentences work by asking the user to write a number between 10 and 20.\n\n3) &quot;For Loop&quot;\nShows how the For Loop works.\n\n4) &quot;Multipliers -For Loop&quot;\nThis one shows how the &quot;For Loop&quot; works showing that it can also multiply. In this one the user is asked to put a StarterNumber, an EnderNumber and a Multiplier, then shows in the ListBox the result for each multiplication.\n\nWell, that was all. If you like this comment it here and I'll add more as I learn. I hope you'll pardon me if you see any grammar mistake, I'm not a natural english speaker, even though I go to classes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d288111cc16729cfd98f8113110044acbf4692e","amp;dn":"4+projects+for+starters+in+VB.Net+and+.Net+Framework+4.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d288111cc16729cfd98f8113110044acbf4692e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,40,129,17,204,22,114,156,253,152,248,17,49,16,4,74,203,244,105,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
