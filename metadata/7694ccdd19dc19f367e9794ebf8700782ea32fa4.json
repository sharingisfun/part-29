She was also the vocalist on a 1950 single for the Detroit-based Fortune Records, that signaled the beginning of Brim's discography.\n\n\nPinetop Perkins was born in Belzoni, Mississippi He began his career as a guitarist, but then injured the tendons in his left arm in a fight with a choirgirl in Helena, Arkansas. Unable to play guitar, Perkins switched to the piano, and also switched from Robert Nighthawk's KFFA radio program to Sonny Boy Williamson's King Biscuit Time.\nHe continued working with Nighthawk, however, accompanying him on 1950's &quot;Jackson Town Gal&quot;.\nIn the 1950s, Perkins joined Earl Hooker and began touring, stopping to record &quot;Pinetop's Boogie Woogie&quot; (written by Pinetop Smith) at Sam Phillips' studio in Memphis, Tennessee. (&quot;They used to call me Pinetop,&quot; he recalled, &quot;because I played that song.&quot;) However, Perkins was only 15 years old in 1928, when Smith originally recorded &quot;Pinetop's Boogie Woogie&quot;.\nPerkins then relocated to Illinois and left music until Hooker convinced him to record again in 1968.\nWhen Otis Spann left the Muddy Waters band in 1969, Perkins was chosen to replace him. He stayed for more than a decade, then left with several other musicians to form The Legendary Blues Band with Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith, recording through the late 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. \nAlthough he appeared as a sideman on countless recordings, Perkins never had an album devoted solely to his artistry, until the release of After Hours on Blind Pig Records in 1988.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - I'm Gonna Let You Go\n02 - Take It Easy Baby\n03 - Let Me Hold You\n04 - High Heel Sneakers\n05 - Driving Wheel\n06 - Naptown\n07 - Going Down Slow\n08 - Call Me Easy Papa\n09 - How Long\n10 - You Put the Heart on Me\n11 - Movin' Out\n\nTracks 1,3.6 &amp; 8\n\nJohn Brim (guitar,vocals)\nJohn Primer (guitar)\nBilly Branch (harmonica)\nWillie Kent(electric bass)\nTim Taylor (drums)\n\n]Recorded: 7 Feb 1979 in Chicago\n\nTracks 2,4,5 ,7 &amp; 9\n\nPinetop Perkins (piano,vocals)\nTim Taylor (drums) (except track 4)\nMicheal Strasser (drums) (track 4)\n\nRecorded: 9 Feb 1990 in Chicago\n\nTracks 10,11\n\nJohn Brim (guitar,vocals)\nGrace Brim(drums)\nJohn Brim Jr (bass)\n\nRecorded: Late 1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s for B &amp; B Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7694ccdd19dc19f367e9794ebf8700782ea32fa4","amp;dn":"John+Brim+and+Pinetop+Perkins++Chicago+Blues+Session+Vol+12%28blue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7694ccdd19dc19f367e9794ebf8700782ea32fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,148,204,221,25,220,25,243,103,233,121,78,191,135,0,120,46,163,47,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
