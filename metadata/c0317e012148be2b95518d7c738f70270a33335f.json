For those of you not familiar with the format, it works like this: each &quot;season&quot;/tournament is 6 games long (5 qualifying games, 1 championship).  Each of the 5 qualifying games is between 5 celebrities, with the winner moving on to the championship.\n\nThe show is hosted by Kevin Pollack &amp; Phil Gordon to start, and Dave Foley &amp; Phil Gordon in later seasons.  All of the celebrities are playing for charity, with the prize pool donated by whoever happens to be sponsoring the season.\n\nThis show airs regularly on Bravo in the US (season 6 should be coming up soon).  This is a complete collection of the first four seasons.  I only have one or two episodes available from season 5, so if anyone has those, please let me know and/or torrent them.\n\nFor those of you that may have a favourite celebrity you want to see, a complete list of all the players follows below (note that I havn't listed who plays in the championships, so as not to ruin any surprises).\n\n\nSeason 1 (1 hour episodes, 2 hour championship)\n\nGame 1 - Ben Affleck, Don Cheadle, Willie Garson, Emily Procter, David Schwimmer\nGame 2 - Timothy Busfield, Allison Janney, Richard Schiff, Martin Sheen, John Spencer\nGame 3 - Hank Azaria, Michael Ian Black, Peter Facinelli, Mo Gaffney, Nicole Sullivan\nGame 4 - Coolio, Shannon Elizabeth, Ron Livingston, Paul Rudd, Sarah Silverman\nGame 5 - David Cross, Carrie Fisher, Tom Green, Mimi Rogers, Scott Stapp\nGame 6 - Championship\n\n\nSeason 2 (this season and all after it, all episodes are 2 hours)\n\nGame 1 - Jerome Bettis, Rosario Dawson, Mena Suvari, Wanda Sykes, Travis Tritt\nGame 2 - Timothy Busfield, Mo Gaffney, Dule Hill, Danny Masterson, James Woods\nGame 3 - Michael Ian Black, Star Jones, Norm MacDonald, Adam Rodriguez, Jeremy Sisto\nGame 4 - Sean Astin, Lauren Graham, Chris Masterson, Matthew Perry, Sara Rue\nGame 5 - James Blake, Jon Favreau, Andy Richter, Tom Everett Scott, Maura Tierney\nGame 6 - Championship\n\n\nSeason 3\n\nGame 1 - Willie Garson, Jennie Garth, Richard Kind, Dave Navarro, Jerry O'Connell\nGame 2 - Angie Dickinson, Jeff Gordon, Kathy Griffin, Penn Jillette, Ron Livingston\nGame 3 - Will Arnett, Jason Bateman, David Cross, Peter Facinelli, Judy Greer\nGame 4 - Michael Badalucco, Bobby Flay, Steve Harris, Kathy Najimy, Mimi Rogers\nGame 5 - Hank Azaria, Seth Meyers, Gail O'Grady, Amy Poehler, Jeffrey Ross\nGame 6 - Championship\n\n\nSeason 4\n\nGame 1 - Christopher Meloni, Matthew Perry, Stephen Root, Sarah Silverman, Michael Vartan\nGame 2 - Bobby Cannavale, Tony Hawk, Cheryl Hines, Dennis Rodman, Ryan Stiles\nGame 3 - Macaulay Culkin, Neil Flynn, Sara Gilbert, Ricki Lake, Kevin Nealon\nGame 4 - Chevy Chase, Donny Deutsch, Shannon Elizabeth, Kathy Griffin, Neil Patrick Harris\nGame 5 - Angela Bassett, Jeff Garlin, Dave Navarro, Mekhi Phifer, Emily Procter\nGame 6 - Championship\n\n\nBravo's page for the TV show can be found here (warning, contains spoilers):\n\nhttp://www.bravotv.com/Celebrity_Poker_Showdown/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0317e012148be2b95518d7c738f70270a33335f","amp;dn":"Celebrity+Poker+Showdown%2C+Seasons+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0317e012148be2b95518d7c738f70270a33335f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,49,126,1,33,72,190,43,149,81,141,124,115,143,112,39,10,51,51,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
