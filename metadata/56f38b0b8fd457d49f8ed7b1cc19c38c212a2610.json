Industry veteran, Louis Frenzel, gives you the real scoop on electronic product fundamentals as they are today. Rather than tearing electronics apart and looking at every little piece, the author takes a systems-level view. For example, you will not learn how to make a circuit but how a signal flows from one integrated circuit (IC) to the next and so on to the ultimate goal.\n\nThis practical application-driven viewpoint and breadth of coverage is unprecedented. This book touches upon TV, audio, satellite, radio, wireless communication, and networking. All of this content is brought to life through hands-on projects that you will enjoy whether you are a hobbyist, student, or engineer.\n\n\n    * A fresh look at how electronics work\n\n    * Learn about the inner workings of your HDTV, cell phone, and video game console\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nLouis Frenzel has been a Technology Editor with Electronic Design magazine since 2000 and covers the wireless, communications, networking and test/measurement fields. He also writes for Wireless System Design Update an online newsletter. Lou has over 25 years of electronic industry experience as an engineer in the geophysical, aerospace and computer fields. Prior to joining ED he was a college professor teaching electronics and semiconductor manufacturing and working on several NSF grants. He holds bachelors and masters degrees in electronics and is author of 19 books on communications, computers and electronics.\n\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 360 pages\n    * Publisher: Newnes; Pap/Psc edition (May 19, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1856177009\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1856177009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f38b0b8fd457d49f8ed7b1cc19c38c212a2610","amp;dn":"Electronics+Explained+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f38b0b8fd457d49f8ed7b1cc19c38c212a2610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,243,139,11,143,212,87,212,159,142,215,177,204,25,195,140,33,42,38,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
