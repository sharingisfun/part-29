Up five notches to number 31, here is sweet Sheena Easton with 'Sugar Walls'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey tells about the song that spent the most amount of time on the hot 100 before entering the top 40, a song about a real life Superman.\n\nThe first woman ever to have five top 40 hits from the same album (and the song that did it for her) is in this countdown.\n\nThere is a song that is the first (and maybe only) song to make the chart twice in the 80's by 2 different acts.\n\nThe talent singing one song in this countdown has an accumulated 218 chart hits.\n\nA lisetner asks, &quot;What acts have had the most hits on the pop chart, on the soul chart, and on the country chart?&quot; Casey says the champ on the pop chart is the King with 139 hits, the Godfather of Soul rules the soul chart with 99 hits, and the man known as the Rolls Royce of Country has had 122 hits on the country chart.\n\nThere is an act in the top 10 that regularly got booed off the stage when they opened for The Rolling Stones just 3 years prior.\n\nThe number one song of 1952 was also the first record to hit number one on the pop chart and the soul chart. Casey plays a piece of it.\n\n40:    Private Dancer - Tina Turner\n39:    Rockin' At Midnight - The Honeydrippers\n38:    In Neon - Elton John            \n37:    Tenderness - General Public\n36:    Mistake No. 3 - Culture Club\n35:    Mr. Telephone Man - New Edition\n34:    Can't Fight This Feeling - REO Speedwagon\n33:    California Girls - David Lee Roth\n32:    Money Changes Everything - Cyndi Lauper\n31:    Sugar Walls - Sheena Easton\n30:    The Old Man Down The Road - John Fogerty\n29:    The Heat Is On - Glenn Frey\n28:    Valotte - Julian Lennon\n27:    Misled - Kool &amp; The Gang        \n26:    Jungle Love - The Time\n25:    Foolish Heart - Steve Perry\nLDD: Lady - Kenny Rogers\n24:    Sea Of Love - The Honeydrippers\n23:    Operator - Midnight Star\n22:    Call To The Heart - Guiffria\n21:    Solid - Ashford &amp; Simpson\n20:    Love Light In Flight - Stevie Wonder\n19:    Do What You Do - Jermaine Jackson\n18:    Cool It Now - New Edition\n17:    Do They Know It's Christmas - Band Aid\n16:    We Belong - Pat Benatar\n15:    The Wild Boys - Duran Duran\n14:    Jamie - Ray Parker Jr.\n13:    Neutron Dance - The Pointer Sisters\n12:    Method Of Modern Love - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n11:    Born In The USA - Bruce Springsteen\n10:    I Would Die 4 U - Prince &amp; The Revolution\n9:    Lover Boy - Billy Ocean\n8:    The Boys Of Summer - Don Henley\n7:    Run To You - Bryan Adams\n6:    All I Need - Jack Wagner\nLDD: Time After Time - Cyndi Lauper\n5:    Careless Whisper - Wham featuring George Michael\n4:    Easy Lover - Philip Bailey\n3:    You're The Inspiration - Chicago\n2:    I Want To Know What Love Is - Foreigner\n1:    Like A Virgin - Madonna","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df32f15e02c7150c960427766350793056d5781b","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1985_January_26th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df32f15e02c7150c960427766350793056d5781b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,50,241,94,2,199,21,12,150,4,39,118,99,80,121,48,86,213,120,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
