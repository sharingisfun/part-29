These feathered beasts\nare revolutionising our understanding of life on Earth as they blur the boundaries between\nwhat we know of dinosaurs and birds.\n\nChina sits at the heart of the feathered dinosaur discoveries and is the home of one of the\nmost unusual discoveries on Earth: the epidexipteryx. Only the size of a pigeon, this predator\nwas the most bird-like of any dinosaur and is the first known case of ornamental feathers.\n\nBut feathers were not just confined to the small. From caudipteryx to sinosauropteryx and the\n8-metre-long gigantoraptor, feathers may have been used for flight, for insulation or even to\nintimate and attract. These dinosaurs not only hint at how animals might have developed\nflight, but also suggest that dinosaurs may still live among us today - as birds.\n\nJohn Hurt ...
