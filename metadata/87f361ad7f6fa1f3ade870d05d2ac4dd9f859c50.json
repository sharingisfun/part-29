Tracing a handful of interconnected lives, ``Changing Times&quot; explores larger global concerns as intimately as possible.\n\nLooking trimmer than he has in years, Depardieu is Antoine, a successful land developer who's overseeing a project in that famously international city Tangier, which, of course, is where CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cile (Deneuve) has been living for some years. She's a host on Arab radio, married to a slightly younger Moroccan doctor, Natan (Gilbert Melki). Their son, Sami (Malik Zidi), has just blown in from Paris with a lady friend named Nadia (Lubna Azabal) and Nadia's little boy, and CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cile is slightly mystified but opens her home to them anyway.\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitles: English and Portuguese\n\nvideo codec: xvid\naudio codec: mp3\nbitrate: 878kb/s\nresolution: 576x336\nFPS: 25,000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f361ad7f6fa1f3ade870d05d2ac4dd9f859c50","amp;dn":"Andr%C3%83%C2%A9+T%C3%83%C2%A9chin%C3%83%C2%A9+-+Les+Temps+qui+changent+AKA+Changing+Times","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f361ad7f6fa1f3ade870d05d2ac4dd9f859c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,243,97,173,127,111,161,243,173,232,112,208,93,42,196,221,159,133,156,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
