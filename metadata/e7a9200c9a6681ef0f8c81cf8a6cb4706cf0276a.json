It features guest vocals by rapper Yung Joc and was produced by Jim Jonsin. The song was released as the album's lead single on August 4, 2006 in the United States and on October 20, 2006 in Europe. While &quot;Show Stopper&quot; peaked at number 8 on the official Billboard Hot 100 chart, it managed to enter the top 30 in Germany. The single also charted in the top 20 on the Pop 100 charts, and top five status on the US Top Digital Downloads and Hot 100 Dance Club Play charts.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Show Stopper&quot; was directed by Jessy Terrero (director of the movie Soul Plane, Teairra Mari's single No Daddy and many of G-Unit's videos), and was filmed in various locations throughout Los Angeles, California between June 27 and 28, 2006. Apart from rapper Yung Joc whose part was filmed inside his van while he was on his way back to the airport because of a lack of time, Diddy also recorded a sequence with his verse in the song which appears in the remix version of the music video and features only the girl's full dance portion of the original version.\n\nThematically, the video starts with the band members in the recording studio listening to their album cut &quot;Want It&quot; with Diddy as he tells them to go straight to bed and not go out and club hop. Then the girls go into a van and get &quot;made up&quot; and then go out on the town in expensive cars, looking for boys and flirting. The video ends with the girls dancing on the Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe final version of the video premiered at the end of Making the Video on MTV on August 4, 2006. It reached a peak position of number two on TRL on September 8, 2006. The video also finished #6 on MTV's top videos of 2006 countdown.\n\nThe single was released on the U.S. iTunes Music Store on August 15, 2006, and peaked at number two on the top 100 songs after two days of downloading only. The following week &quot;Show Stopper&quot; instantly debuted at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the one of the highest debuts of 2006 behind Taylor Hicks's &quot;Do I Make You Proud&quot; and BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s &quot;Ring the Alarm&quot;. While the song reached its peak position of number 8 in its second week, radio play and popularity on iTunes declined and it eventually fell out of the top 25. However, about 5 weeks after the radio release, the song finally started gathering airplay and subsequently moved back up the Hot 100, again peaking at number 12. It was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 2006.\n\nWhile the song failed to chart or sell noticeably in Austria, the song became a top 30 success in Germany with a peak position of number 27.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7a9200c9a6681ef0f8c81cf8a6cb4706cf0276a","amp;dn":"Danity+Kane+feat.+Yung+Joc+-+Show+Stopper++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7a9200c9a6681ef0f8c81cf8a6cb4706cf0276a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,169,32,12,154,102,129,239,15,140,129,207,138,108,180,112,108,240,39,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
