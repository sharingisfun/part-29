Ever. Peek.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Ari Alexander just broke that rule and saw the last person she expected hovering above her bed Ã¢â‚¬â€ arrogant Jackson Locke, the most popular boy in her school. She expects instant execution or some kind of freak alien punishment, but instead, Jackson issues a challenge: help him, or everyone on Earth will die.\n\nAri knows she should report him, but everything about Jackson makes her question what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been taught about his kind. And against her instincts, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s falling for him. But Ari isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just any girl, and Jackson wants more than her attention. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a military legacy whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been trained by her father and exposed to war strategies and societal information no one can know Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially an alien spy, like Jackson. Giving Jackson the information he needs will betray her father and her country, but keeping silent will start a war.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3294bc8dc9209ecdb8b0cbda004c65853a0a59a","amp;dn":"Gravity+by+Melissa+West+%28The+Taking+01%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3294bc8dc9209ecdb8b0cbda004c65853a0a59a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,41,75,200,220,146,9,236,219,139,12,189,160,4,198,88,83,160,165,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
