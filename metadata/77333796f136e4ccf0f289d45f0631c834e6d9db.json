Under the Putin regime they have proliferated and importantly seem set to remain RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most active armed agencies for the immediate future. In parallel, within the murky world where government and private interests intersect, a number of paramilitary Ã¢â‚¬Ëœprivate armiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ operate almost as vigilantes, with government toleration or approval.This book offers a succinct overview of the official, semi-official and unofficial agencies that pursue Russian government and quasi-government objectives by armed means, from the 200,000-strong Interior Troops, through Police and other independent departmental forces, down to private security firms. Featuring rare photographs, and detailed colour plates of uniforms, insignia and equipment, this study by a renowned authority explores the Putin regimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadowy special-forces apparatus, active in an array of counter-terrorist and counter-mafia wars since 1991.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Russian-Security-Paramilitary-Forces-since/dp/1780961057&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Russian-Security-Paramilitary-Forces-since/dp/1780961057&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77333796f136e4ccf0f289d45f0631c834e6d9db","amp;dn":"Russian+Security+and+Paramilitary+Forces+since+1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77333796f136e4ccf0f289d45f0631c834e6d9db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,51,55,150,241,54,228,204,240,242,137,212,95,6,49,200,52,230,217,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
