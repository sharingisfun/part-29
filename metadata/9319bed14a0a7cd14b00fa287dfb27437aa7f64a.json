You are one of the more fortunate ones, still free to roam Myrtana. Freedom affords you the option to stay true to the throne of the deposed human king, serve the Orcish usurpers, or carve your own path. Every decision made will have an impact on the fate of humanity and the balance of power. The choice is yours to make and will influence all those living in the shadow of the Orcs.\n\nGothic 3 is as non-linear as an RPG can get without losing a sense of purpose. Its huge, living world holds many treasures, breathtaking locations, and dark secrets. It is a giant playground in which you have total freedom. Gothic 3 suffered from a rocky start due to some bugs initially after launch. This version of the game, however, is patched and updated and offers a vastly smoother experience that makes it much easier for you to get drawn into the engaging world and its many plots.\n\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nHEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 5 BUNDLE\nINQUISITOR\nDaikatana\nMessiah\nChildren of the Nile Complete\nStill Life 1\nGhost Master\nGemini Rue\nTo The Moon\nDarwinia\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nTwo Worlds 2\nThief Gold\nPsychonauts\nFahrenheit\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9319bed14a0a7cd14b00fa287dfb27437aa7f64a","amp;dn":"Gothic+3+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9319bed14a0a7cd14b00fa287dfb27437aa7f64a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,25,190,209,74,10,124,209,75,0,250,40,125,251,39,67,122,167,246,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
