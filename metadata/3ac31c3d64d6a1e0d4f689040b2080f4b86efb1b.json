The pioneers of PTFE developed an astonishing mass of basic and applied technical work. Now many of these experts are retiring and a new generation is taking their place. This new generation brings a plethora of skills, built upon the basic knowledge of fluoropolymer technology. \r\n\r\nSpeaking to the needs of today's engineering and science students and practicing professionals, this book provides an in-depth treatment of homofluoropolymer polymerization and part fabrication technology. A comprehensive range of issues surrounding the manufacturing of the monomer; polymer, fabrication, end-use, safety, and disposal are covered. The book has been arranged to allow self-managed reading and learning. It is both a source of data and a reference","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ac31c3d64d6a1e0d4f689040b2080f4b86efb1b","amp;dn":"Fluoroplastics+Vol.+1+-+Non-Melt+Processible+Fluoroplastics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ac31c3d64d6a1e0d4f689040b2080f4b86efb1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,195,28,61,100,214,161,224,212,246,137,4,11,32,128,244,184,110,251,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
