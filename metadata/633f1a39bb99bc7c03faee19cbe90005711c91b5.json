He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl boldly crosses over to the boys' side and outruns everyone.\n\nThat's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Together they create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits. Then one morning a terrible tragedy occurs. Only when Jess is able to come to grips with this tragedy does he finally understand the strength and courage Leslie has given him.\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Fantasy | Classics | Academic | Adventure | Realistic Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633f1a39bb99bc7c03faee19cbe90005711c91b5","amp;dn":"Bridge+to+Terabithia+-+Katherine+Paterson+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633f1a39bb99bc7c03faee19cbe90005711c91b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,63,26,57,187,153,188,124,3,250,238,25,203,233,0,5,113,28,145,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
