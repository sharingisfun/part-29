While not as exquisite as Beat and, for some, apparently quite run-of-the-mill (except the single Freedom Fighter, the only song with guitar), Lushlife has the rare quality of being solid on almost all of the songs. Best listened to while driving around the city late at night.\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Floating World (4:44)\n2. Lushlife (7:52)\n3. Shook Ones (4:50)\n4. Psalms of Survival (4:40)\n5.
