Now, it is set to transform every sector and economic system on the planet in almost unimaginable ways Ã¢â‚¬â€ even those once thought to be immune from its effects. In his groundbreaking new book Vaporized, digital pioneer and business futurist Robert Tercek takes us inside the world's largest cultural and economic transformation since the industrial revolution, and explains what it means to consumers, employers and policy makers. Dynamic and engaging, Tercek does for digital business theory what Malcolm Gladwell has done for sociology, translating a complex, arcane subject in approachable and relevant terms. In contrast to the digital-era doomsayers and hand-wringing pundits, Tercek offers an insightful, optimistic analysis of the future and a practical blueprint for survival that no business leader, from the Fortune 500 CEO to the small startup owner, can afford to ignore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67c7246be5a0fa14c3bc122b2922f97380b34e1","amp;dn":"Vaporized%3A+Solid+Strategies+for+Success","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67c7246be5a0fa14c3bc122b2922f97380b34e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,124,114,70,190,90,15,161,76,59,193,34,178,146,47,151,56,11,52,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
