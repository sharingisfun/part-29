Four great nations-the Federation, the Klingon Empire, the Tholian Assembly, and the Romulan Star Empire-have all taken tremendous risks in their race to learn and control the ancient technologies of the ancient interstellar hegemons known as the Shedai. Now get ready for an all-new adventure in the Taurus Reach on Starbase 47 with the starship crews, undercover agents, civilian colonists, and alien power players of the Vanguard saga, based on Star Trek: The Original Series.\n\nCold Equations 3: the Body Electric\nAt the centre of the Galaxy, a planet-sized Machine of terrifying power and unfathomable purpose hurls entire star systems into a supermassive black hole. Wesley Crusher, now a full-fledged Traveller, knows the Machine must be stopped...but he has no idea how.
