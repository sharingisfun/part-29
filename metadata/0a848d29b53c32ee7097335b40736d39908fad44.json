Here, the album title alone is enough to catch oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GlierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s precise phrasing and subtle touches that make for an engaging start-to-finish listen. Whether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing solitary ballads like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everything BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Am Only as Loved as I Am OpenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or tackling the more vigorous refrains that spark Ã¢â‚¬Å“Man I Used to BeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Down to the Wire,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Glier draws emotional power from the slightest of suggestions. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not to say this Massachusetts native is some brooding shoegazer. On the swampy-sounding Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Stars and GlitterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and brassy Ã¢â‚¬Å“New World I See,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Glier livens up the proceedings with some welcome infusions of energy. Still, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a master of nuance, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimately what makes Things I Should Let You Know an album with so much to reveal.
