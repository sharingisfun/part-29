Notorious debunker of fabricated phantom stories, Dr. Ignatius Lynch, has had quite enough of the publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obsession in titillation and intrigue! With the failing sales of his recent book, an investigation of the Carstair Hill dig is just what Dr. Lynch needs to prove once and for all that frivolous talk of the supernatural is absurd. \nTake on the role of Dr. Lynch, an infamous writer who has dedicated his career to debunking the paranormal. Find hidden objects, solve puzzles and explore a village reluctant to give up the healthy tourism this &quot;haunting&quot; has delivered. Dr. Lynch: Grave Secrets is a bone-chilling adventure where myth, mystery and a healthy dose of skepticism converge.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11cbc8a8873acac33e7262723a3a9f79481ab20a","amp;dn":"iWin+Dr.+Lynch%3A+Grave+Secrets+-+RaBBiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11cbc8a8873acac33e7262723a3a9f79481ab20a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,203,200,168,135,58,202,195,62,114,98,114,58,58,159,121,72,26,178,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
