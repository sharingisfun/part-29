Red Harvest is more than a superb crime novel: it is a classic exploration of corruption and violence in the American grain.\n\n\n&quot;An acknowledged literary landmark.&quot;  --NY Times Book Review.\n\n&quot;Dashiell Hammett is an original. He is a master of the detective novel, yes, but also one hell of a writer.&quot; -- Boston Globe\n\n&quot;Hammett's prose [is] clean and entirely unique. His characters [are] as sharply and economically defined as any in American fiction.&quot;\n\n--The New York Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b198eeb9b04071026edc7c037c0e3cf068972280","amp;dn":"Red+Harvest+-+Dashiell+Hammett+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b198eeb9b04071026edc7c037c0e3cf068972280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,152,238,185,176,64,113,2,110,220,124,3,124,14,60,240,104,151,34,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
