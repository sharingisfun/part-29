Rather than waiting to be redeployed to the front, the soul-sick Inman deserts, and embarks on a dangerous and lonely odyssey through the devastated South, heading home to North Carolina, and seeking only to be reunited with his beloved, Ada, who has herself been struggling to maintain the family farm she inherited. Cold Mountain is an unforgettable addition to the literature of one of the most important and transformational periods in American history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4986788b29055353197fb3711bded57c1912810","amp;dn":"Cold+Mountain+by+Charles+Frazier+%28Retail%29+%7BRose88%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4986788b29055353197fb3711bded57c1912810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,152,103,136,178,144,85,53,49,151,251,55,17,189,237,87,193,145,40,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
