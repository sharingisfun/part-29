Against Nature contains many themes which became associated with the Symbolist aesthetic. In doing so, it broke from naturalism and became the ultimate example of decadent literature. Jean Des Esseintes is the last member of a powerful and once proud noble family. He has lived an extremely decadent life in Paris which has left him disgusted with human society. Without telling anyone, he absconds to a house in the countryside. He fills the house with his eclectic art collection and decides to spend the rest of his life in intellectual and aesthetic contemplation. Throughout his intellectual experiments, he recalls various debauched events and love affairs of his past in Paris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:502328e7683abd85544578aaa191918368e8b1b9","amp;dn":"Against+Nature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"502328e7683abd85544578aaa191918368e8b1b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,35,40,231,104,58,189,133,84,69,120,170,161,145,145,131,104,232,177,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
