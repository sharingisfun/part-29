One afternoon, however, she is kidnapped by a group of self-styled fashion-obsessed artists who call themselves &quot;Paradise Kiss.&quot; Yukari suddenly finds herself flung into the roller-coaster life of the fashion world, guided by George, art-snob extraordinaire. In a glamorous makeover of body, mind and soul, she is turned from a hapless bookworm into her friends' own exclusive clothing model.\n\nIn this manga we meet characters from Gokinjo Monogatari like Mikako (and her little sister, Miwako - she's in the &quot;ParaKiss&quot; group) and Arashi's father (only a poster, but still), as well as new characters like Isabella.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e7492a334b7b48f4d64676b0a30eca239aeacd0","amp;dn":"Paradise+Kiss+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e7492a334b7b48f4d64676b0a30eca239aeacd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,116,146,163,52,183,180,143,77,100,103,107,10,48,236,162,57,174,172,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
