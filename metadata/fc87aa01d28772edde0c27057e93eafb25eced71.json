Info on artist, label, and releases below.\n\n\n\nFull: Shyft Trakia-Vorga VahtiDahl. Born in Stillwater, Minnesota, United States. Currently resides in Mahtomedi, Minnesota.\n\nThis is ShyftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gabber/hardcore/breakcore/drillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢bass project. Distorted heavy bass kicks, thick synths, and powerful melodies are the aim here- unless itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chopped up progressive percussion.\n\nShyft started playing with music composition at age twelve and production at age fourteen in the year 2003.Stubbornness and impatience cause this artist to learn music programming almost entirely first hand and through trial and error. Experimentation is responsible for the final mix of many tracks. Influences come from many places, and not just the gabber or brain dance scene. It ranges from techno, trance and house genre classes to organic genre classes such as folk and metal.\n\nShyftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical philosophy focuses on a continuous struggle to make tracks sound better, clearer, and more crisp, as well as breaking down boundaries of genre in terms of both composition and production.\n\nSome where near the beginning of Shyft's musical career the Shyfted Minds label name was being kicked around, but it wasn't until 2008 that the name really went in to use, being an outlet for Shyft's hard core project, Red Ankh, and Philopsycho Lawlawlawl. Ã‚Â The label today has a heavy focus on electronic hard core with a few other small time artists on board with the most recent projects, but is hoped to expand to other genres and build a community of artists. Ã‚Â It is headed by Shyft with the support of Kyat Dittman. Ã‚Â Until 2013 all albums and EPs were released digitally in 320kbps completely free of charge, though donations were accepted. Ã‚Â Since spring of 2013 select releases are provided digitally for sale, due to economic constraints.  If influence is taken from any one other label, it would have to be Cardiac Records.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nConcerning this discography, there is much to be said, but for the sake of simplicity basic style shall be noted as it differs from release to release.\n\nBeat Shyfter, Drudge, Random Overload, Dark Nozzalgi EP, The Magnificent Metalloid Man EP, and Pots and Pans EP are experimental electronic music.\n\nBlootenast Disk, I Can Twist Too, The Good Old Days, The Highlander EP, Life Within The Mind, The Kingdom of the Future EP, Silence... Shadows, In Check, and HonoR are hard core/gabber.\n\nHer Dark Square is symphonic break core, and My Webbing Come Undone EP is remixes of its first track in different heavy genres.\n\nRise of the New Industrial EP is a mix of industrial hard core and electro industrial trance.  Some weirdos call that stuff 'terror EBM'.\n\nVociferous Euphony EP, Split Sanity EP, Hard Drive, Over Driven EP, and Suspended in the Infinite Gabber Space are hard core/gabber splits with other artists.\n\nNew Collective Audition is a hard core/gabber remix compilation.\n\nThrow Me A Happycore Record is happy hard core/UK hard core inspired by eighties sound tracks and folk music.  No joke.  This artist's style is eclectic.\n\n&quot;O&quot; OST is a MIDI video game music inspired sound track to Shyft's original science fiction/fantasy novel, &quot;O&quot;.\n\nThe remixes folder contains random songs transformed in to hard core/gabber.\n\nThe extras are all hard core/gabber that are mixes or unreleased tracks.\n\n\nFind it all where it belongs:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shyftedminds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shyftedminds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc87aa01d28772edde0c27057e93eafb25eced71","amp;dn":"Shyft+Discography+%28Hardcore%2FGabber%2FExperimental%2C+2003-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc87aa01d28772edde0c27057e93eafb25eced71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,135,170,1,210,135,114,237,222,12,39,5,126,147,234,251,37,236,237,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
