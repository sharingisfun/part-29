Gender discrimination takes center stage in discussions of internal pay equity, but many other protected characteristics may be invoked as grounds for alleging discrimination: age, race, disability, physical appearance, and more. This broad range of vulnerability to discrimination charges is often neglected in corporate assessments of how well compensation systems comply with the law and satisfy employee norms of fairness. Blind spots in general equity constitute a serious threat to organizational performance and risk management. In Compensating Your Employees Fairly, a respected practitioner and consultant lays out in practical terms everything you need to know to protect your company along the full spectrum of internal pay equity issues, including all the technical methods you need to optimize compliance and minimize risk. \n\nCompensating Your Employees Fairly is a timely survey and comprehensive handbook for compensation specialists, HR professionals, EEO compliance officers, and in-house counsel. It provides all the information you need to ensure that compensation systems are equitable, auditable, internally consistent, and externally compliant with equal employment opportunity laws and regulations. The author presents technical informationÃ¢â‚¬â€both legal and statisticalÃ¢â‚¬â€in common-sense terms. Her non-technical breakdown of complex statistical concepts distills just as much as practitioners need to know in order to effectively deploy and interpret the standard applications of statistical analysis to internal pay equity. The focus throughout the book is on real-world application, current examples, and up-to-the-minute information on recent and pending wrinkles in the evolving legal landscape. \n\nReaders of Compensating Your Employees Fairly will learn: \n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Why internal equity in compensation matters\n- How to detect intentional and non-intentional discrimination in compensation\nThe basics of statistical inference and multiple regression analysis\nThe essentials of data availability, measurability, and collection\nThe criteria for assessing compensation systems for internal equity\n- How to investigate potential problems and react to formal complaints and actions\n- How to avoid litigation and put in place ongoing measures for proactive self-auditing\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn :\n-------------------\n\nReaders of Compensating Your Employees Fairly will learn:\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Why internal equity in compensation matters\n- How to detect intentional and non-intentional discrimination in compensation\n- How to investigate potential problems and react to formal complaints and actions\n- How to avoid litigation and put in place ongoing measures for proactive self-auditing\n\nWho this book is for :\n----------------------\n\nHR professionals, compensation specialists, EEO compliance officers, in-house counsel, and employment attorneys will find invaluable the expert authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s non-technical treatment of the technical issues that are essential to understanding all facets of internal pay equity.
