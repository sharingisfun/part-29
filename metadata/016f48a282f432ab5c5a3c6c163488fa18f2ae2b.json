He received a Master of Arts in Literature from the University of Copenhagen in 1984. Peter HÃƒÂ¸eg published his first novel, A History of Danish Dreams, in 1988 to very positive reviews. In the years that followed he wrote and published the short story collection Tales of Night, and four novels: Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992), Borderliners (1993), The Woman and the Ape (1996), and The Quiet Girl (2006). It was Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow that earned HÃƒÂ¸eg immediate and international literary celebrity. His books are published in Denmark by Munksgaard/Rosinante, now a part of Blackwell Publishing, and have also been published in more than 30 other countries.\nIn 1993 he won the Danish booksellers award De Gyldne LaurbÃƒÂ¦r (The Golden Laurel) and the Danish Critics Prize for Literature for his book De mÃƒÂ¥ske egnede (English title: Borderliners).\nHÃƒÂ¸eg has a reputation for being hard to place in terms of literary style. All his works are stylistically very different from one another, and have been labelled post-modern, gothic, magical-realist, to mention a few. There is a red thread to be found, however, in terms of theme; HÃƒÂ¸eg's work often seems to deal with the consequences of the progress of civilization.\n\n* Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (US: Smilla's Sense of Snow) (Frk.
