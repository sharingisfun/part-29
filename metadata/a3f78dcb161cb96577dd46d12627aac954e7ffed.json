When the police turn up,  \n                    they are both called in to be interviewed.  \n                    Their names were listed by the family as close  \n                    friends of Sophia's, even though Emily knows  \n                    they'd never met her. Emily learns that Naomi  \n                    was dealing pills with Cook in the club that  \n                    night and sold one to Sophia. Behind Naomi's  \n                    back, Emily visits Sophia's family - she needs  \n                    to know why the family had their names. She  \n                    discovers that the dead girl claimed to be best  \n                    friends with Naomi and Emily. Whilst looking  \n                    around Sophia's bedroom Emily secretly pockets  \n                    a key. Effy's return has drawn a line under  \n                    Cook and Freddie's joint denial-fest. Though  \n                    they keep their distance from Effy at first,  \n                    Cook later sees Effy and Freddie get together.  \n                    In haste he lashes out - assaulting a random  \n                    party-goer - and gets nicked. Emily realises  \n                    that the key she found is for Sophia's locker  \n                    and inside she finds a shrine to Naomi.
