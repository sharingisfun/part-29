Derek Jeter is their hero. He walks in the footsteps of Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, and Mantle, and someday his shadow will loom just as large. Yet he has never been the best player in baseball. In fact, he hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always been the best player on his team. But his intangible grace and Jordanesque ability to play big in the biggest of postseason moments make him the face of the modern Yankee dynasty, and of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game.\n\nIn The Captain, best-selling author Ian OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor draws on extensive reporting and unique access to Jeter that has spanned some fifteen years to  reveal how a biracial kid from Michigan became New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beloved sports figure and the enduring symbol of the steroid-free athlete. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor takes us behind the scenes of a legendary baseball life and career, from JeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early struggles in the minor leagues, when homesickness and errors in the field threatened a stillborn career, to his heady days as a Yankee superstar and prince of the city who squired some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beautiful women, to his tense battles with former best friend A-Rod. We also witness Jeter struggling to come to terms with his declining skills and the declining favor of the only organization he ever wanted to play for, leading to a contentious contract negotiation with the Yankees that left people wondering if Jeter might end his career in a uniform without pinstripes.\n\nDerek JeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s march toward the Hall of Fame has been dignified and certain, but behind that leadership and heroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grace there are hidden struggles and complexities that have never been explored, until now. As Jeter closes in on 3,000 hits, a number no Yankee has ever touched, The Captain offers an incisive, exhilarating,\nand revealing new look at one of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest players in the gloaming of his\ncareer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0ba83f229da5d3c6d9e884de8559a43ef4399b","amp;dn":"The+Captain%3A+The+Journey+of+Derek+Jeter+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0ba83f229da5d3c6d9e884de8559a43ef4399b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,11,168,63,34,157,165,211,198,217,232,132,222,133,89,164,62,244,57,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
