(NO MORE &quot;CANNOT INSTALL TO THE SELECTED DESTINATION ERROR&quot;!)\nThat's right, you can install Windows XP on your flash drive and even on your camera (If the internal NAND is large enough).\n\nThis version of windows is FULLY activated and is GENUINE. The installation process is semi-unattended, all you need to fill out is your name.\n\nRECOMMANDED REQUIREMENT:\n\nThe performance of the operating system varies on what flash storage device you used.\nI recommend  you to use flash drives/cards that have a minimum write speed of 10mb/s to ensure a good performance and startup time, or at least a flash drive with ReadyBoost support.\n Although these requirements are not mandatory, but highly suggested. A computer with USB 2.0 or higher is a MUST (At least for installation), unless you don't mind staring at the progress bar for 24 hours or more.\n\nWhen installing, plug the flash drive directly into a USB port of your PC rather than a hub if possible.\n\nAnd of course, make sure your computer meets the minimum requirement for Windows XP. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that this disk can be used to install both normally, or onto removable media!!\n\nOther than SATA drivers and the modified files to enable installation on USB devices, everything else on the disk is UNTOUCHED!\n\nI modified and ripped the disk, feel free to redistribute it as long as placing my name as the original creator. I am also known as .ISO/dotISO, and BiN4RY\n\nPlease seed people, I can only seed for a limited amount of time at 75% of my bandwith, which is incredibly slow!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee9cade9f06220469f27094969e6c0b45262dbb","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+SP3+Pro+Corp+USB+INSTALLABLE+Semi-Unattended","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee9cade9f06220469f27094969e6c0b45262dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,233,202,222,159,6,34,4,105,242,112,148,150,158,108,11,69,38,45,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
