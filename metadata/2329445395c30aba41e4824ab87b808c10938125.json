Nick Drake is an admitted reference point for Roberts, though the influence is perhaps more apparent in texture than actual sound. This was, after all, recorded in RobertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sydney home Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s folk music baked with inner-city Australian sun. That said, songs like Barking Dog &amp; Swallow occasionally bring to mind Joe BoydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more lush arrangements for Drake. There are acoustic-psych touches to the material, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more subtly-toned than the widescreen Byrds vistas of his day-job band. Roberts is ultimately his own man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inevitable parts of his record collection seep intoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the music, they never overwhelm the songs. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find any blatant facsimiles of other artists here, not even of Belles. Instead, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a low-key selection of songs that Roberts delivers in an almost-reluctant voice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in the wrong hands, this could sound indifferent and uncommitted, but RobertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hesitance sounds vulnerable and even a little bit haunted. It adds an interesting dynamic to what are essentially sun-kissed and, at times, even vibrant songs.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/03/22/the-maple-trail/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/03/22/the-maple-trail/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2329445395c30aba41e4824ab87b808c10938125","amp;dn":"The+Maple+Trail...Cable+Mount+Warning%282012%29%5BFLAC%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2329445395c30aba41e4824ab87b808c10938125","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,41,68,83,149,195,10,186,65,228,130,74,184,123,128,140,16,147,129,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
