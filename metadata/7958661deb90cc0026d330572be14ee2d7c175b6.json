L. Moreno has made an immense contribution to psychotherapy as a whole through his development of the powerful method of group psychotherapy known as psychodrama. In Psychodrama Since Moreno, internationally recognized exponents of the psychodramatic method, many trained by Moreno himself, examine recent innovations in theory and practice to establish the key concepts of psychodrama today. They go on to demonstrate how they have taken these key concepts and developed them in their practice of psychodrama, presenting clinical material to help the reader understand in a direct and practical way. This book will stimulate and inform practicing psychodramatists and all mental health professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7958661deb90cc0026d330572be14ee2d7c175b6","amp;dn":"Psychodrama+since+Moreno+-+Innovations+in+theory+and+practice+by","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7958661deb90cc0026d330572be14ee2d7c175b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,88,102,29,235,144,204,0,38,211,48,87,43,225,78,226,215,193,117,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
