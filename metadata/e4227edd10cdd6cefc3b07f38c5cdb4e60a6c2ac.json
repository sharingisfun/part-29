They'd hit the UK top 20 a few times before this with such classics as &quot;My Perfect Cousin,&quot; but &quot;The Love Parade&quot; missed the top 40 and the cover of the Isleys' &quot;Got to Have You Back&quot; failed completely. Feargal Sharkey's voice is very strong, and the whole album's quite good, but it remains an unfortunate example of how to alienate your audience.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4227edd10cdd6cefc3b07f38c5cdb4e60a6c2ac","amp;dn":"The+Undertones+-+The+Sin+Of+Pride+%5B1983%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4227edd10cdd6cefc3b07f38c5cdb4e60a6c2ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,34,126,221,16,205,214,206,252,59,7,243,140,92,219,78,96,166,194,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
