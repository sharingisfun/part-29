It features a cover of Simon and Garfunkel's &quot;I Am a Rock,&quot; which displayed progression for the band at the time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the rising folk-rock nascent was on the horizon. However, Would You Believe also features a cover of Chuck Berry's &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ by 1966, R&amp;B and blues covers were becoming passÃƒÂ©. Another sign of growth for the band on Would You Believe includes the Evie Sands cover, &quot;I Can't Let Go&quot;, a major hit for the band.\n\nBoth the stereo and mono mixes of Would You Believe? were digitally remastered at Abbey Road Studios by Peter Mew in March 1998. In the UK, the remastered album was released with both mixes on one disc.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c5ccd89e5aa672605cca8668a986ccbeef744f9","amp;dn":"The+Hollies+-+Would+You+Believe+%282013%29+Japan+Mini+LP+SHM-CD+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c5ccd89e5aa672605cca8668a986ccbeef744f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,92,205,137,229,170,103,38,5,204,168,102,138,152,108,203,238,247,68,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
