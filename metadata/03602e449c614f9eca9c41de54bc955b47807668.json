Some mathematical thoughts and mathematical technology have also been vital in war. During World War II mathematical work by the Anti-Hitler coalition was part of an aspiration to serve humanity and not help destroy it. At present, it is not an easy task to view the bellicose potentials of mathematics in a proper perspective. The book presents historical evidence and recent changes in the interaction between mathematics and the military. It discusses the new mathematically enhanced development of military technology which seems to have changed the very character of modern warfare.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03602e449c614f9eca9c41de54bc955b47807668","amp;dn":"Mathematics+and+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03602e449c614f9eca9c41de54bc955b47807668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,96,46,68,156,97,79,158,202,156,65,222,84,188,149,91,71,128,118,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
