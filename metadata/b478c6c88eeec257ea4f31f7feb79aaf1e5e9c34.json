But what exactly would that look like, and how can we get there? Anarchism and Its Aspirations provides an accessible overview of an often-misunderstood political philosophy, highlighting its principles and practices as well as its reconstructive vision of a liberatory society.\n\n'A brilliant primer of anarchist politics.'\n-Matt Hern, author of Common Ground in a Liquid City\n\n'I expect Anarchism and Its Aspirations to become the introduction to anarchism of the next decade.'\n-Gabriel Kuhn, editor of Gustav Landauer's Revolution and Other Writings\n\n'A road map to the many social and cultural movements that anarchism has traversed . . . a testimony to its continuing ability to capture the radical imagination.'\n-Silvia Federici, author of Caliban and the Witch\n\n'Uncompromising, practical, and hopeful, this book is essential reading for all who are taking on climate change, war, or corporate capitalism.'\n-David Solnit, coauthor of The Battle of the Story of the &quot;Battle of Seattle&quot;\n\nCindy Milstein is an Institute for Anarchist Studies board member and a co-organizer of the Renewing the Anarchist Tradition conference. Her essays have appeared in several anthologies, including Realizing the Impossible , Confronting Capitalism , and Globalize Liberation.\n\n==========================================================================\n\nThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened.
