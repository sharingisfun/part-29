Not so much a sequel as an upgrade, a breakneck technicolour journey through screwball punk and guitar-fuelled dancefloor heroics, it&amp;#039;s very, very fast and very, very loud; a brilliant racket that proves there&amp;#039;s infinitely more to Arctic Monkeys than\nwriting pretty little ditties, yet at the same time boasting some of the strongest\nsongs they&amp;#039;ve ever written.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a96f0a11a8d8784cc1213d2a6c3fb632a6283f0e","amp;dn":"Arctic+Monkeys+-+Favourite+Worst+Nightmare+-+2007+-+MST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a96f0a11a8d8784cc1213d2a6c3fb632a6283f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,111,10,17,168,216,120,76,193,33,61,42,108,63,182,50,166,40,63,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
