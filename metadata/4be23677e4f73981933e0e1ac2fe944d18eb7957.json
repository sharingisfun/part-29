Javi Garcia isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to tell such stories. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a fire in my belly. And coal in my throat. The words that I spit. Would make most writers choke.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJaviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest release, The Great Controversy is his latest collection of these happy endings. JaviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newest release The Great Controversy is act 3 to a Southern Horror. It creeps in with the familiar outro from Flood, thumping into the clapping, stomping and dirty garage guitar licks of the records first track The Sound. A song about a girl who through choices of her own isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the apple of her DaddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye anymore. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like to hear her fathers truth about her life choices of drug abuse and being a whore, truth hurts sometimes. Nightfall, a story of self destruction by making the same choices over and over expecting a different result.Ã¢â‚¬Å“And you fall. And you fall. Just like the last time. Your doing it again. When you crawl. When you crawl. Right back to nightfall. You just canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t win.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  The title track to the record The Great Controversy, the cosmic battle between good and evil from the devils perspective with a killer honky tonk guitar lick. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You can whisper a prayer. You can shout out a hymn. But it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t change the fact that your more like me than him.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Josephine is the Black Tambourine on this record. Horns, grand piano, slide guitar, shaker and more shaker. This Rolling Stones-esque track is a rock and roll jam session. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We both know baby you werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t born to be queen. So get down honey and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop until its clean. Josephine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSavanna, a story of avenge for the rape and murder of a fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter. Forgiveness from the Lord is the only refuge he seeks. Another punch you in your face, push you down, driving rhythm, To Be Free feels like a conversation with Satan about breaking free from his stranglehold. The horns, accordian and percussion in Cut Throat delivers like the theme song to a Robert Rodriguez flick. The song tells a tale of a barber or in this case barber surgeon who starts cutting the throats of his clientele with his straight razor. He ends up getting the electric chair in the end. Again, Javi and his bedtime stories. 30 Years , eventually nobody is going to give a shit about you. That is my take on it. Stick to the facts is a truth punch to the face. In a world where we are filled with lies, conspiracy and propaganda letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s try to stick to the facts.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Through spider web cracked and broken glass. I let all the world before me pass. This ruthless toothless grinning mask. AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t held in place with candle wax. So letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s try to stick to the facts. Try to stick to the facts. Stick to the facts.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis record sounds like Javi and the players went into a garage, shut the doors, broke the knob off, recorded this record and burnt the place to the ground. There were no survivors and no better understanding of The Great Controversy, all according to the master plan of questions without answers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4be23677e4f73981933e0e1ac2fe944d18eb7957","amp;dn":"Javi+Garcia+-+The+Great+Controversy%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4be23677e4f73981933e0e1ac2fe944d18eb7957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,226,54,119,228,247,57,129,147,62,14,26,194,254,148,77,24,235,121,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
