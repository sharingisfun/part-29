Does where you were born affect how much money youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll earn over a lifetime? How would we know? WhyÃ¢â‚¬â€beyond the idle curiosityÃ¢â‚¬â€do these questions even matter? In The Haves and the Have-Nots, Branko Milanovic, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading experts on wealth, poverty, and the gap that separates them, explains these and other mysteries of how wealth is unevenly spread throughout our world, now and through time.\nMilanovic uses history, literature and stories straight out of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newspapers, to discuss one of the major divisions in our social lives: between the haves and the have-nots. He reveals just how rich Elizabeth BennetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suitor Mr. Darcy really was; how much Anna Karenina gained by falling in love; how wealthy ancient Romans compare to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s super-rich; where in Kenyan income distribution was ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandfather; how we should think about Marxism in a modern world; and how location where one is born determines his wealth. He goes beyond mere entertainment to explain why inequality matters, how it damages our economics prospects, and how it can threaten the foundations of the social order that we take for granted.\nBold, engaging, and illuminating, The Haves and the Have-Nots teaches us not only how to think about inequality, but why we should.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Review\nFrom Booklist\n*Starred Review* Milanovic defies the typical image of an economist by presenting research overlaid with humor, literary insights, and fully imagined portraits of daily life as he examines inequality across time and continents. He weighs the wealth divide between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice as well as Anna KareninaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s financial prospects had she married Vronsky. He ponders John Rawls, Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, Max Weber, and others to explore theories regarding the rich and the poor. Using complicated economic models that he explains very well, Milanovic breaks down incomes to make comparisons between the haves and the have-nots within nations, between nations, and among citizens of the world. He offers vignettes that make his concepts all the more accessible and entertaining as he explains the errors of Marxism and why a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relative wealth is determined more by their country of origin than by their familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealth. Milanovic writes as much like a philosopher as an economist as he ponders the growing trend of inequality in income around the world and answers questions many readers likely ask themselves about their economic prospects. --Vanessa Bush\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nNew York Times Book Review\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A]n eclectic book on inequalityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. [MilanovicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] colorful vignettesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦are almost uniformly delightful. No matter where you are on the income ladder, MilanovicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s examination of whether Bill Gates is richer than Nero makes for great cocktail party conversation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nNew York Journal of Books\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[Branko Milanovic] has fun with economicsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Behind the fun are some serious concerns about growing global income inequalityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. And underlying the fun facts is a prodigious amount of research: everything from demographic patterns in 13th century Paris to interest rates in ancient Rome.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLibrary Journal\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A]n innovative look at price and consumption differencesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Students, practitioners, and anyone interested in economics and the issue of inequality would enjoy this.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBooklist, starred review\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Milanovic defies the typical image of an economist by presenting research overlaid with humor, literary insights, and fully imagined portraits of daily life as he examines inequality across time and continentsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Milanovic writes as much like a philosopher as an economist as he ponders the growing trend of inequality in income around the world and answers questions many readers likely ask themselves about their economic prospects.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nKirkus Reviews\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A] timely look at the inequality of income and wealthÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Authoritative.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSimon Johnson, Professor at MIT Sloan and co-author of the national bestseller 13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A brilliant tour through inequality, writ large and small, across the ages. Economics is often considered as Ã¢â‚¬ËœdismalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and you may not be cheered up by what has been regarded as an acceptable distribution of income in the past (and what may be coming to our future). But The Haves and the Have-Nots is far from being a dismal book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is entertaining, draws you in, and makes you think; this is the right way to draw attention to the substantive issues. Enrollments in economics courses would rise sharply if more writers followed Branko MilanovicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lead.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMoisÃƒÂ©s NaÃƒÂ­m, Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, author of Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is one of the most entertaining and original books you can read on a hot-button subject that will increasingly dominate the conversations in homes and government offices around the world. Economic inequality has always been part of the human experience and Branko Milanovic masterfully explains why it is still with us and why politicians, policy makers and the public are so often allured by policies that deepen inequality instead of reducing it. A delightful read!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJames K. Galbraith, author of The Predator State: How Conservatives Abandoned the Free Market and Why Liberals Should Too\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Charming, erudite, curious and deeply informed about every aspect of economic inequality. Branko Milanovic takes us on a tour from Austen to Tolstoy, from ancient Rome to modern Brazil via the late Soviet Union. He explores almost all the ways of thinking about inequality that there are. And he makes it seem easy, which it definitely is not.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAngus Deaton, Professor of Economics and International Affairs, Princeton University, 2009 President of the American Economic Association, author of The Analysis of Household Surveys: A Microeconometric Approach to Development Policy\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Where do you rank in the all-time world distribution of income? How about Jane AustenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mr. Darcy? Or Anna Karenina? Was Octavian Augustus richer than Bill Gates? Why might China fall apart, like the USSR and Yugoslavia? Why should we care about differences in income and wealth? In this book of many delights, Branko Milanovic, who has spent 25 years studying global inequality, provides us with a veritable Arabian Nights of stories about inequality, drawing from history, literature, and everywhere in the world. A pleasure to read, and an eye-opener for haves and for have-nots alike.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThomas Pogge, Professor of Philosophy and International Affairs, Yale University, author of World Poverty and Human Rights: Cosmopolitan Responsibilities and Reforms\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Learn about the serious subject of economic inequality while you have plenty of fun traveling around the globe and far back in time! Through fascinating stories and wonderful illustrations, Branko Milanovic explains income and wealth inequality Ã¢â‚¬â€œ their concepts, measurement, evolution, and role in human life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ without compromising precision or balance. This is a delightful book, as commendable for vacations as for the classroom.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Washington Independent Review of Books\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A] thoughtful new book that comes to grips with a much weightier topic, involving one of the biggest issues of our time: the inequality of incomesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. MilanovicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brief and idiosyncratic little book provides quite an education.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Spectator (London)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you have the slightest interest in politics and macro-economics, you should be [in possession of this book].Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTime Out for Entertainment (Denver)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Talk about a timely book. The Haves and the Have-Nots will get your blood boiling. World bank economist and expert on global inequality Branko Milanovic takes us back to a time when the world was divided in the very rich few and impoverished masses. He then jolts us to the present, where everyone in society is unquestionably better off, yet the income of the top 1.75% of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population exceeds that of the bottom 77%.... No socialist manifesto, this is instead a thought-provoking work of how we got where we are and where this imbalance will take us.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nForeign Affairs\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This delightful and quirky book explains in laymanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terms the evolution of income inequality over the years, within countries and between countriesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. A growing volume of data on income distribution within countries and new data on purchasing power comparisons between countries have permitted the authorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to make quantitative generalizations that could once only be guessed at.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nChoice\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[The Haves and the Have-Nots] will keep both specialists and nonspecialists engaged and learning. This is a wonderful book for anyone to readÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Highly recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEdward Chancellor, Financial Times\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The question of bad inequality is addressed at length in [this] entertaining new book by World Bank economist Branko Milanovic.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEthics &amp; International Affairs\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A] compact and lively examination of the nature, history, and causes of inequality.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nBranko Milanovic, lead economist at the World BankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research division in Washington, DC, and professor at University of Maryland, is author of Worlds Apart.
