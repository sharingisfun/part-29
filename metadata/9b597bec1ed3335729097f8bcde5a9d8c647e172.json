Yet it was an ill-defined practice until the 1960s when it emerged as a potent voice in newspapers and on television news programs. In The Evolution of American Investigative Journalism, James L. Aucoin provides readers with the first comprehensive history of investigative journalism in the United States, including a thorough account of the founding and achievements of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). Emerging investigative reporters and editors, as well as students and scholars of journalism history, will benefit from the detailed presentation and insightful discussion provided in this book.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 256 pages\nPublisher: University of Missouri (January 31, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 082621746X\nISBN-13: 978-0826217462\n\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b597bec1ed3335729097f8bcde5a9d8c647e172","amp;dn":"The+Evolution+of+American+Investigative+Journalism+by+James+L.+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b597bec1ed3335729097f8bcde5a9d8c647e172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,89,123,236,30,211,51,87,41,9,127,139,205,229,169,216,198,71,225,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
