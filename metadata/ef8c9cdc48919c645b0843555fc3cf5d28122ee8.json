(MÃƒÂ¤nner...)\n\n1985\n\nDirected by Doris DÃƒÂ¶rrie\n\nin German with English subtitles (that can't be turned off)\n\nHeiner Lauterbach ... Julius Armbrust\nUwe Ochsenknecht  ... Stefan Lachner\nUlrike Kriener    ... Paula Armbrust\n\nWhen Julius finds out that his wife is having an affair he moves out and becomes her \nlover's roommate. Comedy ensues.\n\nA great movie! Made better by NOT being dubbed into English.\n\nThanks to 'leila2' for posting this version in 2010. I had almost given up hope of \nfinding it. All I did was trim off a few seconds from the beginning, and remove the \nlast 20 minutes of static from the end of that one. That reduced the size by half \nwithout affecting the quality. It was recorded from a VHS video tape.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef8c9cdc48919c645b0843555fc3cf5d28122ee8","amp;dn":"Men+-+1985+-+Doris+Dorrie.german+w+engsub.vhs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef8c9cdc48919c645b0843555fc3cf5d28122ee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,140,156,220,72,145,156,100,91,8,67,85,95,195,207,93,40,18,46,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
