I absolutely love all things Elfman/Boingo, and there&amp;#039;s some completely wonderful stuff here. I particularly love Open Eyes, Kiss My Ass, Water (very strange version of a song I had only heard on Farewell previously), and Commando Girls. Quality varies, some of these are very crappy recordings, but musically I just love these guys. I&amp;#039;m proud to make it available on TPB. If anybody knows where to get the video for Farewell, I&amp;#039;d greatly appreciate it. I found a copy of the DVD on amazon for over $100 wtf!?!?!? The VHS I found for 10 bucks...that didn&amp;#039;t make much sense to me. I used to have the VHS, but it was lost years ago, I&amp;#039;d love to get it again. I appreciate any help you might have for me on that one, hope you enjoy this release, it&amp;#039;s Boingo-licious!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba083c33e712302bec759dc79a49279f891fc750","amp;dn":"Oingo+Boingo+Rarities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba083c33e712302bec759dc79a49279f891fc750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,8,60,51,231,18,48,43,236,117,157,199,154,73,39,159,137,31,199,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
