She needs distance from her clueless fiancÃƒÂ©, distance to decide whether she wants to spend the rest of her life with a man who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care enough to learn how she takes her coffee.\n\nArriving in a blinding snowstorm at the A-Frame she rented, she comes face to face with the most amazing man sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever seen. Minutes later, when he kicks her out of his house, she goes head to head with him.\n\nBeyond angry because sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flown half a world away to start her timeout adventure, not to mention her sinuses hurt, she heads back down the mountain and ends up in a ditch. Unable to extricate herself, she gives up, hopes for rescue and falls asleep in the backseat.\n\nThe next morning she wakes up in the amazing manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bed and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sick as a dog.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c355cb958927d8697fe018def40af4cbd7cb233f","amp;dn":"Kristen+Ashley+-The+Gamble","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c355cb958927d8697fe018def40af4cbd7cb233f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,85,203,149,137,39,216,105,127,224,24,222,244,10,244,203,215,203,35,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
