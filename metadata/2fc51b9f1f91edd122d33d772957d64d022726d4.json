Larock (Wiley-VCH, 1999).pdf\r\n\r\nThis long-awaited, greatly-expanded new edition of a best-selling guide offers an encyclopedic and systematic collection of useful synthetic methodology, including tens of thousands of reactions and synthetic transformations. The first edition has been reviewed in the professional journals as &quot;clearly...the first choice for researchers seeking information on synthetic transformations.&quot; And as &quot;useful to anyone who must do organic synthesis, especially those whose focus is not strictly organic chemistry. It provides a...clear road map to the synthetic literature and should be kept within easy reach of the chemist's desk.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fc51b9f1f91edd122d33d772957d64d022726d4","amp;dn":"Comprehensive+Organic+Transformations+2nd+ed+-+Richard+C.+Larock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fc51b9f1f91edd122d33d772957d64d022726d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,197,27,159,31,145,237,209,34,211,61,119,41,87,214,77,2,39,38,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
