Each member of the band is a virtuoso on his or her respective instrument (accordions, violin, double bass), and the extended length of several of the tracks really allows the bandmembers to demonstrate what dazzling soloists they are. The accordion and violin deserve special attention, displaying amazing melodic gifts and impeccable phrasing. The band is joined by vocalist Grazyna Auguscik for &quot;Tsive Ha-Shamayyim,&quot; where she scat-sings along with the melody. There&amp;#039;s certainly no shortage of klezmer and klezmer-inspired music out there, but the stunning virtuosity of the Cracow Klezmer Band makes them an excellent choice.\n\n1 \tEts Hayyim (The Tree of Life) \tBester \t9:12\n2 \tTsive Ha-Shamayyim (The Colors of the Heavens) \tBester \t5:20\n3 \tGil Gul (The Migration of Souls) \tBester \t9:44\n4 \tDim&amp;#039;ot Yisrael (Israel&amp;#039;s Tears) \tBester \t5:42\n5 \tSippuro Shel Shed (A Devilish Tale) \tBester \t3:07\n6 \tHolef (Transience) \tBester \t8:02\n7 \tOtsmat (The Might of the Elements) \tBester \t9:13\n8 \tBereshit \tBester \t5:52","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcc04112f097620278a3dd2f1f78fc56d2948284","amp;dn":"The+Cracow+Klezmer+Band+-+Bereshit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcc04112f097620278a3dd2f1f78fc56d2948284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,192,65,18,240,151,98,2,120,163,221,47,31,120,252,86,210,148,130,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
