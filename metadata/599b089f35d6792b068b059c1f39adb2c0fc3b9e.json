So I automated it to pull in all the books I could, cleaned them up a little, removed the magazines, and added a sprinkling of Creative Commons SF authors, and here we are. Some 7.5 Gb of books.\n\nSince this was an automated process I am sure there are mistakes, omissions, and malformatted files, but the files I have spot-checked looked fine.
