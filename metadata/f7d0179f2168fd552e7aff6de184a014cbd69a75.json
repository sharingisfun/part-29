This can be attributed to the fact that they didn't have a pretty-boy lead singer (in fact, Udo Dirkschneider was the virtual antipretty boy) and, despite a few \n flirtations, never truly crossed over to the MTV masses. But it's not to say that \n they didn't have their share of metal anthems (albeit in a somewhat derivative Judas Priest style), most of which are included on the budget-priced, ten-track \n compilation, No Substitutes. Since most of the group's albums are getting \n increasingly hard to find on CD (and that they arguably only issued three &quot;classic&quot; metal albums: 1983's Restless &amp; Wild, 1984's Balls to the Wall, and 1985's Metal Heart), a short but sweet overview such as No Substitutes comes in handy. Tops include one of the first ever thrash metal tracks to sweep the metal underground,&quot;Fast as a Shark,&quot; the dark &quot;Balls to the Wall,&quot; as well as such head-banging anthems as &quot;Metal Heart&quot; and &quot;London Leatherboys.&quot; Granted, No Substitutes is by far not a definitive Accept comp (too many strong album cuts go unnoticed in favor of such subpar selections as &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; and &quot;Shake Your Heads&quot;), but it does serve as an adequate primer. \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Too high to get it right [03:49] \n 02.Russian roulette [05:23] \n 03.Princess of the dawn [06:16] \n 04.Metal heart [05:23] \n 05.Fast as a shark [03:48] \n 06.Turn me on [05:13] \n 07.Shake your heads [04:17] \n 08.Demon's night [04:28] \n 09.London leatherboys [03:58] \n 10.Balls to the walls [05:43] \n ____ \n \n 48:18 min \n 73,3 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7d0179f2168fd552e7aff6de184a014cbd69a75","amp;dn":"Accept-No_Substitutes-%28Retail%29-1992-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7d0179f2168fd552e7aff6de184a014cbd69a75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,208,23,159,33,104,253,85,46,122,255,109,225,132,160,20,203,214,154,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
