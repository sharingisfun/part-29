Explore the reasons we've used drugs through\nthe ages, while considering the devastating consequences that accompany the choice to use certain drugs. This\nfascinating, fresh, and insightful documentary will ask the question: overall, have drugs done more to help us or\nhurt us? Host Dean Norris (Hank from Breaking Bad) will journey through the millennia and look in on the greatest\ncivilizations in human history to discover if drugs helped these societies flourish or fail and whether drug use\nwas holy or hedonistic, a savior or a curse?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ff0189a16eaf39aca9e3e67fec893fccc5e69a","amp;dn":"History.Channel.The.Stoned.Ages.HDTV.XviD-DiVERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ff0189a16eaf39aca9e3e67fec893fccc5e69a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,255,1,137,161,110,175,57,172,169,227,230,127,236,137,63,204,197,230,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
