In other words, you guys don't need to wait too many days between bundles.  I haven't yet done the statistics for last year, just to be certain, but so far this year, your longest wait time between bundles has only been seven days.  With the average wait time being just a little under five and a half days.  Here is how 2014 has come about so far...\n\nBundle #01 torrented on Jan-30\nBundle #02 torrented on Jan-30 (0 days later)\nBundle #03 torrented on Feb-05 (6 days later)\nBundle #04 torrented on Feb-09 (4 days later)\nBundle #05 torrented on Feb-13 (4 days later)\nBundle #06 torrented on Feb-19 (6 days later)\nBundle #07 torrented on Feb-26 (7 days later)\nBundle #08 torrented on Mar-03 (5 days later)\nBundle #09 torrented on Mar-10 (7 days later)\nBundle #10 torrented on Mar-15 (5 days later)\nBundle #11 torrented on Mar-19 (4 days later)\n\nThat being said, we have now broke the 400 share mark for 2014.  Including today's bundle, we're sitting at 416 releases.  If we average that out between the eleven bundles, it works out to an average of almost 38 titles per bundle.  Assuming you're downloading and listening to everything being shared, is 5.5 days really enough time to listen to 38 titles?  True, many seem to be singles this year.  But probably as many as 30 of those 38 are actual albums.\n\nPersonally, I am probably only listening to two albums per bundle myself.  Maybe three albums, tops.  And certainly not with any sort of regularity.  After all, who has the time?  :)\n\nHIP-HOP/RAP: A.C.E, Christon Gray, D-Tropp, DJ I Rock Jesus, J-Factz.
