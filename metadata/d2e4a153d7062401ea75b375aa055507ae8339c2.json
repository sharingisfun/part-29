Described as a transnational artist, he felt at home and thrived in any country. Zobel was also pulled in several different directionsÃ¢â‚¬â€to Manila where he was a pioneer in the modern art movement, especially in non-objectivism; to Boston and Providence in the United States where he enjoyed the intellectual stimulation within his circle of friends who were artists and writers; and to Madrid, in the company of Spanish artists at the ascendancy of Spanish abstract painting.  Ultimately, Zobel described himself as someone who lives in museums and is happiest when surrounded by books and paintings. His world was the history of art.\n\nThis documentary produced in 2004 serves as a visual walkthrough of ZobelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transition from a more figurative style to his signature meditative, harmonious abstract works, composed primarily of calligraphic lines, gradients and even the positive use of space. From interviews from historians, family, relatives and art critiques, Zobel's art is reflected in a different life. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2e4a153d7062401ea75b375aa055507ae8339c2","amp;dn":"Fernando+Zobel+His+Life+and+Art.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2e4a153d7062401ea75b375aa055507ae8339c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,228,161,83,215,6,36,1,234,117,179,117,170,5,85,7,174,131,57,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
