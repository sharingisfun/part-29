The 2014 improvisational death metal Christmas cover / parody / story has a lot to tell, but we'll let Santa tell you.\n\nIn this release, we abandon being totally clean and tr00 to the original song. Don't worry, the original is completely in there, but let's just say Santa wrote some of his own lyrics.\n\nWithin this torrent is both the FULL version (including the story/narrative) as well as a SONG-ONLY version.\n\nCoffin Fuck is a primarily joke/humor metal band. As a bunch of jerks with a sick sense of humor, there is no goal other than having some ridiculous fun and being metal. Coffin Fuck songs are mostly improvised when recorded and aren't perfected in the least (with the exception of the melody lines on cover songs).\n\nLike usual, this features lots of improvisational bad playing, some stupid/immature humor, and other dumb shit.\n\nFile is MP3 320kbps.\n\nAlso included is the 2014 MS Paint artwork.\n\nIt's also available on Youtube and Facialbook.\n\nWe hope you maybe have a laugh or two, like, share, offend some people, and that it sleighs your ass. Comment and/or rate if you enjoy.\n\nWe've been doing this since 2006, so check out some older ones too (though lacking seeders at this point)!\n\nMerry Deathmass.\n\nSubscribe...\n(2011 and on)\n(prior to 2011)\n\nLike us on Facebook!\n\nOur 2013 Xmas Release:\n\nOur 2012 Xmas Release:\n\nOur 2011 Xmas Release:\n\nOur 2010 Xmas Release:\n\nOur 2009 Xmas Release:\n\nOur 2012 &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; cover:\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tChristmas cover / parody / comedy\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t29.89 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n3 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3b318f104a17b5fbcf7ddbd2c9a611367dce27","amp;dn":"Coffin+Fuck+-+Jolly+Old+Saint+Nicholas+%5BDeath+Metal+Christmas+Pa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3b318f104a17b5fbcf7ddbd2c9a611367dce27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,59,49,143,16,74,23,181,251,207,125,219,210,201,166,17,54,125,206,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
