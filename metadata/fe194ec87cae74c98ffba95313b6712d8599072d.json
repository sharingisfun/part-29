Released on July 5, 1988, the album was the band's second collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose production skills on Slayer's previous album Reign in Blood had helped the band's sound evolve.\nSouth of Heaven was Slayer's second album to enter the Billboard 200, and its last to be released by Def Jam Recordings, although the album became an American Recordings album after Rick Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. It was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros. Records because of original distributor Columbia Records's refusal to release work by the band. The release peaked at number 57 and in 1992 was awarded a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.\nIn order to offset the pace of the group's previous album, Slayer deliberately slowed down the album's tempo. In contrast to their previous albums, the band utilized undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals. While some critics praised this musical change, othersÃ¢â‚¬â€more accustomed to the style of earlier releasesÃ¢â‚¬â€were disappointed. Despite this, the songs &quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot; and the title track became permanent features of the band's live setlist.\n\nripped from original Def Jam 1998 vinyl at 24bit/48khz using ADC into mac using adobe audition.  split, tweaked with click remove, FLAC'ed (24 bit) and here!  enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe194ec87cae74c98ffba95313b6712d8599072d","amp;dn":"Slayer+-+South+Of+Heaven+FLAC+Vinyl+Rip+24bit%3A48khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe194ec87cae74c98ffba95313b6712d8599072d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,25,78,200,124,174,116,201,143,251,169,83,19,182,113,45,133,153,7,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
