This indispensible text has now been thoroughly updated and expanded to reflect new research, and includes previously unavailable source material.\r\n\r\nThis new edition includes expanded sections on marriage and sexuality, and on peasant women and townswomen, as well as a new section on women and the law. There are brief introductions both to the period and to the individual documents, study questions to accompany each reading, a glossary of terms and a fully updated bibliography. Working within a multi-cultural framework, the book focuses not just on the Christian majority, but also present material about women in minority groups in Europe, such as Jews, Muslims, and those considered to be heretics. Incorporating both the laws, regulations and religious texts that shaped the way women lived their lives, and personal narratives by and about medieval women, the book is unique in examining womenâ€™s lives through the lens of daily activities, and in doing so as far as possible through the voices of women themselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab2df7c55d0066eb0a49d90714c5c0394f25c348","amp;dn":"Women%27s+Lives+in+Medieval+Europe+-+Emilie+Amt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab2df7c55d0066eb0a49d90714c5c0394f25c348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,45,247,197,93,0,102,235,10,73,217,7,20,197,192,57,79,37,195,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
