I believe the reason they are so large is because jpegs had been used in place of text. \r\n\r\nThis Book is a good read and even a fun one. \r\n\r\nThe original pdf you can find is very hard to read the way it is set up, I find this version completely necessary if you actually plan on reading this book.\r\n\r\nTotal Synthesis II\r\nby Strike (Illustrator)\r\n \r\n    The most comprehensive and detailed book on the underground production of ecstasy and amphetamines ever published. Step-by-step synthesis recipes with extensive detail are given for more recipes than any other book in existance. Plus, this book represents the first collaboration of the underground.
