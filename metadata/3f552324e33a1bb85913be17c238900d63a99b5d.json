The album was stylistically a much harder, heavier and rawer release than its predecessor (Dead Forever...) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ marking a move away from the band's previous progressive rock influences, although retaining a psych element to their sound. Volcanic Rock had been recorded effectively as a live-in-the-studio effort, with only vocal and additional guitar overdubs added later during the recording sessions.\n\n\n01.
