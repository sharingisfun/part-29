These mysterious, mammoth beings both revered and reviled fueled the expansion of the American economy and enabled Nantucket, a backwater Massachusetts colony settled by religious refugees, to become a capitalist power on a grand and global scale. At the height of the whaling industry, U.S. whaleships encircled the globe, a massive state-of-the-art fleet crewed by highly-skilled mariners whose ever-widening search for prey enabled them to chart the seven seas. Once slaughtered for the precious oil that filled their massive heads a high-quality illuminant that lit the drawing rooms of Europe and greased the wheels of the Industrial Revolution these magnificent creatures once again have a role to play at the new struggle to supply to our energy needs. As man continues to exploit resources and hunt species out of existence, this look at whaling s past is stark reminder of not only the volatility of the global marketplace but the danger of viewing the planet and its creatures as commodities.\n\n\n &quot; I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this DVD but soon after popping it into the DVD player, I was hooked. This is the best American Experience documentary I have ever seen. &quot;\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img29/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img29/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img854/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img854/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img688/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img688/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img822/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img822/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img507/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img507/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img651/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img651/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img37/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img37/2853/intothedeepamericawhali.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1245 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 114.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 1.09 GB (1,120 MB)\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Extra's Run-time 20mins 250MB\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/whaling/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/whaling/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7dc77d26c48c3c7d2c413f01ff39b9def02582d","amp;dn":"PBS+Into+the+Deep+America+Whaling+and+the+World+Extra+1+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7dc77d26c48c3c7d2c413f01ff39b9def02582d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,220,119,210,108,72,195,199,210,196,19,240,31,243,155,157,239,2,88,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
