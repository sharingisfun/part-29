It tells an intense dramatic tale of Dido and her fanatical love for Aeneas (induced by Cupid), Aeneas' betrayal of her and her eventual suicide on his departure for Italy. The playwrights depended upon Books 1, 2, and 4 of the Aeneid of Virgil as their main source.\n\n\nEdward II (a two-parter from the Vivat Rex series)\n\nThe play telescopes most of Edward II's reign into a single narrative, beginning with the recall of his lover, Piers Gaveston, from exile, and ending with his son Edward III's execution of Mortimer Junior for the king's murder.\n\nMarlowe's play opens at the very outset of the reign, with Edward's exiled favourite, Piers Gaveston, rejoicing at the recent death of Edward I and his own resulting ability to return to England.\n\n\nThe Massacre at Paris\n\nThis play concerns the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre, which took place in Paris in 1572, and the part played by the Duc de Guise in those events. It is a coded attack by the atheist Marlowe against the hypocrisies of both the catholics and protestants.\n\nand, of course, not forgetting:\n\nThe Tragical History of Dr. Faustus\n\nThis play highlights one of Marlowe's great passions: the occult. Marlowe was himself a part of the Northumberland/Raleigh 'school of the night' and this play is heavily influenced by their great mentor, the Italian intellectual and occultist, Giordano Bruno.\n\n\nSource: \n\nThe Reckoning - The Murder of Christopher Marlowe (Charles Nicholl)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71450feed467bd393524202dfb875a68c6e976e3","amp;dn":"Christopher+Marlowe+-+His+4+Greatest+Plays+%28BBC+Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71450feed467bd393524202dfb875a68c6e976e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,69,15,238,212,103,189,57,53,36,32,45,251,135,90,104,198,233,118,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
