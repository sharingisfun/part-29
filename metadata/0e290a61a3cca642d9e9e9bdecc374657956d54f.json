The story spans a whole century and several continents.\n\nI've loved this movie since I first saw it in 1974. I've been waiting to show it to my wife for years and was delighted to find it had been put on DVD. It went along wonderfully until what I had known as to be the end suddenly jumped into an additional 20 minutes containing a futuristic (for 1974) pessimistic segment of the story. Although it tied into an earlier scene in the film (also left out of the original release), it was easy to see why this had been left out (in the US at least)...IT WAS STUPID. Furthermore, it changed the entire context of the film. What had been a wonderfully romantic story showing how two people destined to find each other after the events of their lives have shaped them had now become some bizarre cut rate version of Soylent Green. Such a shame. At least when a movie like this is released on DVD they could have made the &quot;unedited version&quot; optional, as was done on the My Darling Clementine DVD. All it shows me is that the editor is usually right from the start and giving the director's a chance to re-cut their film does not always result in an improvement.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072307/\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Toute.une.Vie.1974.Lelouch.Original.cut.FZB.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 716,126 KB or 733,313,024 bytes)\nRuntime......: 02:10:10 (234,062 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 695 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 47 kb/s, monophonic VBR \nFrame Size...: 656x400 (1.64:1) [=41:25]\n\nCiao","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e290a61a3cca642d9e9e9bdecc374657956d54f","amp;dn":"Toute.une.Vie.1974.Lelouch.Original.cut.FRENCH.eng.subs.FZB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e290a61a3cca642d9e9e9bdecc374657956d54f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,41,10,97,163,204,166,66,217,233,233,189,236,195,116,101,121,86,213,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
