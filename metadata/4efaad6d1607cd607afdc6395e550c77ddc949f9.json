Now, after a lifetime of recording thoughts and events, hardships and victories, he has opened his personal archive, which offers unprecedented insight into his remarkable autobiography.\nFrom letters written in the darkest hours of his twenty-seven years of imprisonment to the draft of an unfinished sequel to Long Walk to Freedom, Conversations with Myself gives readers access to the private man behind the public figure. Here he is making notes and even doodling during meetings, or transcribing troubled dreams on the desk calendar in his prison cell on Robben Island; writing journals while on the run during the anti-apartheid struggle in the early 1960s, and conversing with friends in almost seventy hours of recorded conversations. Here he is neither icon nor saint.\n\nAn intimate journey from the first stirrings of political consciousness to his galvanizing role on the world stage, Conversations with Myself  is a rare chance to spend time with Nelson Mandela the man, in his own voice: direct, clear, private.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02600/mandela-obama_2600254b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02600/mandela-obama_2600254b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nabout author :-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://meritocracyparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nelson-mandela.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://meritocracyparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/nelson-mandela.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNelson Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa, on 18 July 1918. He joined the African National Congress in 1944 and was engaged in resistance against the ruling National Party's apartheid policies after 1948 before being arrested in August 1962. In November 1962 he was sentenced to five years in prison and started serving his sentence at Robben Island Prison in 1963 before being returned to Pretoria, where he was to later stand in the Rivonia Trial. From 1964 to 1982, he was again incarcerated at Robben Island Prison and then later moved to Pollsmoor Prison, during which his reputation as a potent symbol of resistance to the anti-apartheid movement grew steadily.\n\nReleased from prison in 1990, Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and was inaugurated as the first democratically elected president of South Africa in 1994. He is the author of the international bestsellers Long Walk to Freedom and Conversations with Myself.\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n\n\nprabhu_ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4efaad6d1607cd607afdc6395e550c77ddc949f9","amp;dn":"nelson+mandela+my+conversation+with+myself","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4efaad6d1607cd607afdc6395e550c77ddc949f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,250,173,109,22,7,205,96,122,253,198,57,94,85,12,119,221,201,73,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
