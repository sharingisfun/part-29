Hendrix's\ninnovative style of combining fuzz, feedback and controlled distortion created a new\nmusical form. Because he was unable to read or write music, it is nothing short of\nremarkable that Jimi Hendrix's meteoric rise in the music took place in just four short\nyears. His musical language continues to influence a host of modern musicians, from\nGeorge Clinton to Miles Davis, and Steve Vai to Jonny Lang.\n\nJimi Hendrix, born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942, at\nSeattle's King County Hospital, was later renamed James Marshall by his father, James\n&quot;Al&quot; Hendrix. Young Jimmy (as he was referred to at the time) took an interest in music,\ndrawing influence from virtually every major artist at the time, including B.B. King, Muddy\nWaters, Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Holly, and Robert Johnson. Entirely self-taught, Jimmy's\ninability to read music made him concentrate even harder on the music he heard.\n\nAl took notice of Jimmy's interest in the guitar, recalling, &quot;I used to have Jimmy clean up\nthe bedroom all the time while I was gone, and when I would come home I would find a\nlot of broom straws around the foot of the bed. I'd say to him, `Well didn't you sweep up\nthe floor?' and he'd say, `Oh yeah,' he did. But I'd find out later that he used to be sitting\nat the end of the bed there and strumming the broom like he was playing a guitar.&quot; Al\nfound an old one-string ukulele, which he gave to Jimmy to play a huge improvement\nover the broom.\n\nBy the summer of 1958, Al had purchased Jimmy a five-dollar, second-hand acoustic\nguitar from one of his friends. Shortly thereafter, Jimmy joined his first band, The\nVelvetones. After a three-month stint with the group, Jimmy left to pursue his own\ninterests. The following summer, Al purchased Jimmy his first electric guitar, a Supro\nOzark 1560S; Jimi used it when he joined The Rocking Kings.\n\nIn 1961, Jimmy left home to enlist in the United States Army and in November 1962\nearned the right to wear the &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; patch for the paratroop division. While\nstationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Jimmy formed The King Casuals with bassist Billy\nCox. After being discharged due to an injury he received during a parachute jump, Jimmy\nbegan working as a session guitarist under the name Jimmy James. By the end of 1965,\nJimmy had played with several marquee acts, including Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke,\nthe Isley Brothers, and Little Richard. Jimmy parted ways with Little Richard to form his\nown band, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, shedding the role of back-line guitarist for\nthe spotlight of lead guitar.\n\n\n\nLabel: BOX-9\nRelease Country: ITALY\nRelease Date: 1993\n3 Disc Set, W/ Booklet, 24 Tracks, &quot;Fan Club&quot; Release, Silver Discs\n\n\nAdditional info courtesy of Hawkfan369 and confused ...
