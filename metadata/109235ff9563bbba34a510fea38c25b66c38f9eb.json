This critically acclaimed novella involves a U.S. Air Force test pilot recruited for a very special mission: to fly an operational recovered UFO. Any test pilot s dream, right? Wrong. Special disfiguring surgery is required for anyone human who wants to fly the craft. This expertly plotted novella proves to detractors that Lee can write in many arenas, not just horror, and doesn t have to rely on the gross-out to keep readers enthralled. (Lee has implied that he may one day expand this project to novel-length, just as he hopes to expand his hard sci-fi TRIAGE novella 2202.) OPERATOR B made the Preliminary Ballot for 1999 HWA Stoker Award for Best Novella. Little known fact: the working outline for this novella was a screenplay, which is also the case for his well-reviewed conspiracy/UFO novel THE STICKMEN.
