Bomgardner - The Story of the Roman Amphitheatre\nRoutledge 2001 | English | 305 pages | PDF | 9.91 MB\n\nThe Roman amphitheatre was a site both of bloody combat and marvellous spectacle, symbolic of the might of Empire; to understand the importance of the amphitheatre is to understand a key element in the social and political life of the Roman ruling classes.\nGenerously illustrated with 141 plans and photographs, The Story of the Roman Amphitheatre offers a comprehensive picture of the origins, development, and eventual decline of the most typical and evocative of Roman monuments.\nWith a detailed examination of the Colosseum, as well as case studies of significant sites from Italy, Gaul, Spain and Roman North Africa, the book is a fascinating gazetteer for the general reader as well as a valuable tool for students and academics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ba7073eca8c4a50f0fd7f4cfec7340ed0ffb4a","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+the+Roman+Amphitheatre+%28Architecture+History+Art+Eb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ba7073eca8c4a50f0fd7f4cfec7340ed0ffb4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,186,112,115,236,168,196,165,15,15,215,244,207,236,115,64,237,15,251,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
