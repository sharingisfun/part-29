IS THERE\r\nANY WAY THAT INDIA CAN ACCEPT YOUR LIFE-AFFIRMATIVE ATTITUDE AND BECOME RICH,\r\nEVEN WITHOUT ACCEPTING YOUR RELIGIOUSNESS WHICH IS SPREADING ALL OVER THE\r\nWORLD?\r\nquestion 2:\r\nBELOVED Master,\r\nI USED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE IN CONTACT WITH EACH OF US IN SOME ESOTERIC,\r\nMAGICAL WAY. I THOUGHT YOU KNEW EACH OF US. I FELT COMFORTABLE, FULL OF TRUST.\r\nNOW EVERYTHING IS CONFUSED.\r\nI FEEL DOUBT. I DON'T KNOW IF GOD EXISTS OR NOT. BUT I CANNOT PRAY TO HIM OR\r\nBELIEVE IN HIS PRESENCE LIKE A GREAT FATHER. AND YOU ARE SAYING YOU DON'T KNOW\r\nOUR NAMES OR WHO WE ARE. I FEEL ABANDONED.\r\n\r\nI AM AFRAID THAT IF I LEAVE AND DON'T HEAR YOUR WORDS, I AM GOING TO MISS\r\nSOMETHING. I AM AFRAID I AM GETTING CLOSED INSTEAD OF OPEN. I FEEL LIKE A CAMEL\r\nLOST IN THE DESERT. ARE YOU DOING OTHER WORK WITH US BEYOND WORDS?\r\n\r\nFirst, now you are in a right situation: confused, abandoned; all your consolations have been taken away - God, the Master.... \r\nQuestion 3:\r\nBELOVED OSHO,\r\nI HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE THE LAZIEST MAN IN THE WORLD. IS THIS THE\r\nREASON WHY IN YOUR COMMUNE THE SANNYASINS ARE SO BUSY, FAR MORE BUSY THAN\r\nPEOPLE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD? PLEASE COMMENT.\r\n\r\nIt is true. I am the laziest man in the whole world. And to keep me lazy, my people have to work. \r\n\r\ndownload Osho audios and books from oshoworld(dot)com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce4b47e844c0f56d2d0474f9a8beaf8f23ece66","amp;dn":"Osho_From+Death+to+Deathlessnes+%2313.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce4b47e844c0f56d2d0474f9a8beaf8f23ece66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,228,180,126,132,76,15,86,210,208,71,79,154,139,234,248,242,62,206,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
