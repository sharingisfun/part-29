Dannii often cites Janet Jackson as her inspiration and this shows on &quot;Until We Meet Again&quot;, a slick, funky dance-affair with sexy vocals. &quot;Love's On Every Corner&quot; was co-written by Cathy Dennis (Of big sis' Kylie's &quot;Can't get you outta my head&quot; fame) and is very &quot;US&quot; sounding with it's streetwise, urban vibe and funky beat. Club diva Juliet Roberts provides the backing vocals. On &quot;Get Into You&quot; there are many down-tempo tracks, a type of track not associated with Dannii publicly, since all of Dannii's singles have been dancey. &quot;I Dream&quot; shows off her beautiful voice and is one of the highs of the album, with it's dreamy feel. Also featured is a rather interesting cover of The Jackson's &quot;Show You The Way To Go&quot;. Hit single &quot;This Is The Way&quot; is the typical Minogue dance/pop tune, but is somewhat more credible to Dannii's earlier efforts such as &quot;Jump To The Beat&quot; and This Is It&quot;. It has big housey beats and soaring pianos and a catchy chorus. However, in contrast, &quot;Lucky Tonight&quot; and &quot;Kiss And Make Up&quot; both sound very sexy and &quot;Black&quot; and doesn't sound like Dannii at all. But they still work well. And finally, the title track is a rock outing with a poppy feel. All in all, a great album - go buy it NOW!\nReviewed by sing365.com\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] This Is It\n[02] Love's On Every Corner\n[03] Until We Meet Again\n[04] Tonight's Temptation\n[05] Be Careful\n[06] I Dream\n[07] Show You The Way To Go\n[08] Lucky Tonight\n[09] This Is The Way\n[10] Get Into You\n[11] If You Really\n[12] Wish You'd Stop Wishing\n[13] Kiss And Make Up\n[14] Show You The Way To Go (12&quot; Version)\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:06m:01s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 418mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
