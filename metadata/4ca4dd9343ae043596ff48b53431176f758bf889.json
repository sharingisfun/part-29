Troubled and  \n                    lonely without his sister and fed up with  \n                    Libby's well-intentioned interference at home,  \n                    Liam finds solace in his friendship with the  \n                    old man. But when Libby spies on Liam and his  \n                    secret friend, she jumps to the all the wrong  \n                    conclusions - leading to a tragic confrontation  \n                    between the Gallaghers and Reggie. Maxine is  \n                    shocked when her brother, Bruce turns up  \n                    sporting a black eye claiming a homophobic  \n                    attack by his own dad, but her loyalties are  \n                    tested when she confronts their father and  \n                    discovers the real story. Bruce's arrival as an  \n                    openly gay man on Chatsworth agitates the  \n                    locals and he quickly outstays his welcome at  \n                    Ian's house, but charms his way into Mimi's  \n                    heart and the Jockey, leaving Micky teetering  \n                    on the brink of a nervous breakdown.
