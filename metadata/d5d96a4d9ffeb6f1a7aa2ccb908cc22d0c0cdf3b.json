The Six Sacred Stones picks up eighteen months later - 20 August 2007 - on Easter Island, the geographical opposite of the Great Pyramid, when seven men use a second Capstone to nullify the power of the Tartatus sunspot and remove Australia's invincibility.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5d96a4d9ffeb6f1a7aa2ccb908cc22d0c0cdf3b","amp;dn":"02+-+The+Six+Sacred+Stones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5d96a4d9ffeb6f1a7aa2ccb908cc22d0c0cdf3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,217,106,77,159,254,182,241,167,170,44,203,144,140,194,45,12,12,223,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
