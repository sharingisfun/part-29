If few recognize that distinction, then it's because the Brothers Four were also part of a largely forgotten chapter in the history of folk music in America.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nExcellent and very logical pairing of two classic LPs on one CD -- both were recorded in concert and feature the group in good form, singing beautifully and presenting generally light-hearted folk standards (&quot;Winken, Blinken &amp; Nod,&quot; etc.), along with the group's one big hit, &quot;Greenfields,&quot; in what is probably its best released version. A fond and spirited look back at folk music as entertainment, and potentially a far more rewarding look at the group than either its greatest-hits or best-of compilations.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r443753&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r443753&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=================\n\nThe Brothers Four in Person\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nOne of the better live folk albums of its period, The Brothers Four In Person, cut live at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD, and Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, is a good representation of their sound. The songs include a somewhat upbeat version of &quot;The Midnight Special,&quot; and a banjo-driven, deliberately paced &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; (which segues into &quot;This Train&quot;), the humorous &quot;Thinking Man, John Henry&quot; (including digs at the John Birch Society, the CIA, Ford, M.I.T., and automation), and a group of beautifully harmonized folk numbers, &quot;Darlin' Sportin' Jenny,&quot; the hit &quot;Greenfields,&quot; George Gershwin's &quot;Summertime&quot; (credited as &quot;San Miguel&quot; on the jacket), and the rousing &quot;I Am a Roving Gambler.&quot; The group also has fun with the &quot;Theme from Peter Gunn,&quot; and, especially, parodying the 45-rpm market with &quot;Variations On an Old English Theme&quot; -- the very fact that they went over big at the Naval Academy as well as Vanderbilt University (where Flatt &amp; Scruggs weren't necessarily considered sufficiently highbrow) also shows the chasm that was soon to open up between this generation of folkies and the more confrontational outfits that were to follow.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95992&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95992&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=================\n\nCross-Country Concert\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nThe group's second live album in less than a year is different from In Person, being less formal in nature (including a topical reference or two to Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle). Recorded at concerts on several difference campuses throughout the United States, Cross-Country Concert captures the group in a generally lighter mood than In Person, doing less substantial but equally attractive fare. &quot;Wish I Was in Bowling Green,&quot; &quot;Brady, Brady, Brady,&quot; and &quot;The New 'Frankie and Johnny' Song&quot; could hardly be mistaken for serious songs, but they are done in rousing fashion. They work in one Shel Silverstein song, &quot;Boa Constrictor,&quot; which is as far out as this group ever got -- most of the rest of the record, however, is more along the lines of &quot;Winken, Blinken and Nod,&quot; which is sung in an achingly delicate manner. Their introduction to Lord Burgess' &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; seems a little incongruous, but it's difficult to argue that their harmonizing on the song isn't gorgeous. Moreover, the group has a certain degree of fun at the expense of the folk revival on &quot;A Symphonic Variation,&quot; and also works in a nasty topical joke aimed at the John Birch Society and a topical comment about racial strife in the South (which amazingly made it onto the finished record), explaining that their concert is being recorded as well as broadcast &quot;to our armed forces -- in Mississippi.&quot; In all, this is the perfect, more immediate companion to In Person, and in 1999 they were finally combined onto the same CD.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cross-country-concert-r95995/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cross-country-concert-r95995/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000025AP2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000025AP2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
