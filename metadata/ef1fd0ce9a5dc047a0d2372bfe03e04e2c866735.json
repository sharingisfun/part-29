She deftly uses her pencil to create thick, expressive characters moving through the twilight of a shadowy Orwellian world. Humorous and bewitching at the same time, Percy Gloom is a unique gem of a story. The story begins with our hero bravely striking out on his own for the first time, leaving his mother's house to apply for his dream job as a cautionary writer for the Safely-Now Corporation. In the process, he uncovers an unreal world of secret societies, benevolent families, and bureaucratic security. Lazy-eyed Percy Gloom fights to overcome the loss of his wife, Lila, to a truth-pointing, lotharian cult leader. Approached by his doctor to help protect some special people and given advice by some talking goats, Percy comes to terms with his place in the gloomy world and finds himself reaching enlightenment (literally). Percy Gloom is an absurd but hopeful fable for these strange times we live in.\n\n2008 Eisner Award winner: Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award and 2008 Eisner Award Nominee: Best New Graphic Album.\n\n\nOther work by Cathy Malkasian...\n\nTemperance &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7725537/Cathy_Malkasian_-_Temperance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7725537/Cathy_Malkasian_-_Temperance&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef1fd0ce9a5dc047a0d2372bfe03e04e2c866735","amp;dn":"Cathy+Malkasian+-+Percy+Gloom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef1fd0ce9a5dc047a0d2372bfe03e04e2c866735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,31,208,206,154,93,192,71,160,210,55,43,254,3,224,78,44,134,103,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
