Ã¢â‚¬Å“Darwinism,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to most persons in the Western world today, usually connotes Ã¢â‚¬Å“the struggle for existence,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“the survival of the fittest,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“nature, red in tooth and claw,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“the strongest survive, the weakest go to the wall,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“eat or be eaten,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“dog eat dog,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“competition,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and similar notions, all of them endowed with a content of combativenessÃ¢â‚¬â€and all of them unsound.\n\nThe layman is not to be blamed for holding ideas that were largely conveyed to him, either directly or indirectly, by scientists who were themselves addicted to these erroneous ideas. The biologists of the nineteenth century, and many of their leading interpreters, were largely responsible for the spread of these erroneous notions, while, paradoxically enough,\nthey were at the same time making the basic facts available upon which a sound theory of evolution could be developed. Unfortunately, what was sound and what was unsound in the theory of evolution became inextricably mixed for most people, and they either accepted the mixture or wholly rejected it....
