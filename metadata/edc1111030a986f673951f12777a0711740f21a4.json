Higginbotham, clarinetist Buster Bailey, and the great tenor Coleman Hawkins. &quot;I Cover the Waterfront&quot; has a wonderfully abstract statement from Allen, &quot;Love Is Just Around the Corner&quot; is joyous Dixieland, &quot;Let Me Miss You, Baby&quot; is a particularly strong blues (featuring Allen's vocal), and the simple blues line that serves as a melody on &quot;Algiers Bounce&quot; is quite catchy. The other seven selections from the classic veterans are also quite enjoyable. Although the music has its basis in Dixieland and swing, the solos of Allen and Hawkins in particular look ahead toward the future. There is nothing dated about these essential performances; highly recommended.
