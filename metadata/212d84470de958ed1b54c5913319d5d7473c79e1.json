Pine has aessembled a number of producers, including such names as Roni Size and Attica Blues, giving them the go-ahead to rework selected moments from Modern Day Jazz Stories and Underground.  All of the selections have now been recast as drum'n'bass crossover tracks, and they work surprisingly well, showcasing the freshness of Pine's playing while revealing that there is true improvisation and jazz within the busy jungle grooves. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, AMG\n\nCourtney Pine has made good albums and as Another Story shows, he has been a great inspiration to many others. Usually hearing re-mixes makes you think about one or two things that are better in the re-mix than in the original.  But when you hear this album you just have to admit that actually all the titles have their own stories.  All the stories are about their authors.  And the authors aren't bad, no not at all: 4hero, Roni Size, Flytronix etc.  You know all of them.  So you take one of those tracks and hope to hear something from the re-mixer.  You'll hear it, but you have never heard anything as good from only himself.  You'll never hear sth quite the same good from him in the future.  'Cause he'll never write a song with Courtney Pine.  So get you hands on this one quickly. ~ Peter T.
