In the beginning Julian &amp; David loved playing and listening to black metal music. Their playing style changed with each song they created together until they found a sound that would eventually become AbsentiA. &quot;Symphonic Death Metal&quot;.\n\nAfter releasing their first album &quot;Heaven Still Burns&quot; in 2009, AbsentiA was included on the Spanish tour with The Haunted &amp; Forever It Shall Be. After returning home they played with Brainstorm, and other shows followed with the likes of Avulsed, Darksun, Sound of Silence...\n\nIn 2011 AbsentiA turned their focus from playing shows and entered into Dynamita Studios to record their 2nd full-length album titled Our Bleeding Sun. AbsentiA teamed up with producer/engineer Dani G. who helped create this intricate &amp; powerful album Our Bleeding Sun. The new album is the natural progression from 2009's Heaven Still Burns. Our Bleeding Sun is faster, more aggressive and will catch your attention from beginning to end.\n\n&quot;From the deepest desires often come the deadliest hate&quot; (Socrates)\n\n\n\nSecon Album by Spanish Band AbsentiA\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69f5ce587fa8abd589c768a41ee12e24744ed6e0","amp;dn":"Absentia+-+Our+Bleeding+Sun+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69f5ce587fa8abd589c768a41ee12e24744ed6e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,245,206,88,127,168,171,213,137,199,104,164,30,225,46,36,116,78,214,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
