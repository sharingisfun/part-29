It&amp;#039;s So Simple\n\nComputerTime has been designed for parents like you. Entering limits is simple, with step-by-step instructions along the way. You can set different limits for each child. Give additional minutes using the unique Time Token feature. At special times, change limits with the Alternate Limit feature.\nHow ComputerTime Works... It Couldn&amp;#039;t Be Easier\n\nYou enter time limits for each child. Your child sees only the ComputerTime Logon, preventing use of any other program until they enter their password. \n\n With their limit approaching, ComputerTime displays warning messages at 15, 10, 5, and 1 minute. When out of time, the screen is cleared, showing only the ComputerTime Logon again. Your child may log off at any time before reaching their limit to save time for later.\nComputerTime runs on:\n\n    * Windows Vista\n    * Windows XP (Home and Professional)\n    * Windows 2000\n    * Windows ME (Millennium)\n    * Windows 98SE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbc373836d1434bb2ee566142164497d32d67d7","amp;dn":"ComputerTime+V2.x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbc373836d1434bb2ee566142164497d32d67d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,188,55,56,54,209,67,75,178,238,86,97,66,22,68,151,211,45,103,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
