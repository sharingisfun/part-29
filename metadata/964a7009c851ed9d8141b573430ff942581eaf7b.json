Nearly every classic\r\npower ballad is here -- &quot;Heaven,&quot; &quot;High Enough,&quot; &quot;Is This Love,&quot; &quot;To\r\nBe With You,&quot; &quot;Don't Know What You Got Til It's Gone,&quot; &quot;More Than\r\nWords,&quot; &quot;Headed for a Heartbreak,&quot; &quot;When I See You Smile,&quot; &quot;When I'm\r\nWith You,&quot; and the Scorpions' end of the Cold War epic &quot;Winds of\r\nChange&quot; -- and those that don't quite make &quot;classic&quot; status are\r\nusually listenable (with the notable exception of Steelheart's &quot;I'll\r\nNever Let You Go [Angel Eyes]). Ultimately, the missing tracks and\r\nthe mediocre cuts don't drag down the disc, since the core of this\r\ncollection consists of the best power ballads known to man. What\r\nexactly that means is subject to interpretation.\r\nMonster Ballads\r\nCompilation album by Various artists\r\nMonster Ballads is the first in a series of compilation albums\r\nthat feature popular power ballads,\r\nusually from the glam metal genre.\r\nIt was released in 1999.\r\nDuration: 01:12:20\r\n\r\nGenre: Pop/Rock\r\n\r\nStyles: Album Rock, Arena Rock, Contemporary Pop/Rock, Hair Metal,\r\nHard Rock, Heavy Metal, Pop-Metal\r\n\r\nReleased: June 29, 1999\r\n\r\nGenre: Glam metal, hard rock, pop rock, soft rock\r\n\r\nLabel: Razor &amp; Tie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:964a7009c851ed9d8141b573430ff942581eaf7b","amp;dn":"Monster+Ballads%28Various+Artists-Rock+-+MP3%29%7BCTShoN%7D%5BCTRC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"964a7009c851ed9d8141b573430ff942581eaf7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,74,112,9,200,81,237,157,129,65,181,115,67,15,249,66,88,30,175,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
