Fifteen-year-old Edie Fraser and her mother, Sydney, have been trying to do just that for five years. Now, things have gone from bad to worse. Not only has Edie had to move to another new school Ã¢â‚¬â€ she's in a different country.\n\nSydney promises her that that this is their chance at a fresh start, and Edie does her best to adjust to life in London, England, despite being targeted by the school bully. But when Sydney goes out to work the night shift and doesn't come home, Edie is terrified that the past has finally caught up with them.\n\nAlone in a strange country, Edie is afraid to call the police for fear that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be sent back to her abusive father.
