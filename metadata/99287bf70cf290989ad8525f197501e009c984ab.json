The name (folk + earth) symbolizes musicians from all over the world playing folk music. So far, a total of twelve full-length albums have been released, with the most recent being &quot;Balder's Lament&quot;\n\nThe history of the group began in February 2003 when the idea for creating a project which could unite musicians from different countries who play folk and pagan metal originated from some musicians. A Nordic Poem album was released in 2004.\n\nBecause of the bad quality of this record, the band decided to remaster and reissue their debut. On 2006-09-01, shortly after the reissue of A Nordic Poem the second album titled By the Sword of My Father was released. Many bands, such as Van Langen, Thiasos Dionysos, Hildr Valkyrie, Death Army, The Soil Bleeds Black joined Folkearth in the production of this album, so the total line-up consisted of 31 musicians from 8 different countries. Folkearth's album Drakkars in the Mist was released 2007-05-28 with the biggest lineup then to date. More than 30 musicians worked on the 4th album. However, a token performance on a single track will list someone on the booklet as a full-fledged member. The band members also don't make money out of the project, and do not promote it, probably because of the lack of funds.\n\nBecause of the musical project's complex structure, Folkearth has not performed live, and it's unlikely they will perform live in the future.\n\nOn the 30th of June 2013, the Founder and Leader of the band Ruslanas Danisevskis (Metfolvik) has passed away after a long fight against cancer.unlikely they will perform live in the future.\n\nOn the 30th of June 2013, the Founder and Leader of the band Ruslanas Danisevskis (Metfolvik) has passed away after a long fight against cancer.\n\nBand Members:\n\nGreece\nMarios &quot;Prince Imrahil&quot; Koutsoukos (Dol Amroth, Folkodia)\nHildr Valkyrie (Hildr Valkyrie, Folkodia)\n\nArgentina\nJuan Churruarin (Juskko/ZrymgÃƒÂ¶ll, Folkodia)\n\nMonaco\nSaga (Black Knight Symfonia, Folkodia)\nAnaÃƒÂ¯s Chevallier (Black Knight Symfonia, Folkodia)\n\nGermany\nNostarion (DÃƒÂ¤mmerfarben, Dystertid, Throndt, Funeral Procession, Falkenbach, Folkodia)\nDennis Schwachhofer (Vroudenspil, Folkodia)\n\nUnited States\nKyle Freese (Anno Domine)\n\nItaly\nGianluca Tamburini (Folkodia)\n\nFrance\nEmily Cooper\n\nRussia\nYanina Zelenskaya\n\nDiscography:\n\nA Nordic Poem (2004)\nBy the Sword of My Father (2006)\nDrakkars in the Mist (2007)\nFather of Victory (2008)\nSongs of Yore (2008)\nFatherland (2008)\nRulers of the Sea (2009)\nViking's Anthem (2010)\nSons of the North (2011)\nMinstrels by the River (2011)\nValhalla Ascendant (2012)\nBalder's Lament (2014)\n\n\n\nBalder's Lament (2014)\n - ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99287bf70cf290989ad8525f197501e009c984ab","amp;dn":"+Folk+Earth+-+Balders+Lament+-+Discography+++mp3+++++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99287bf70cf290989ad8525f197501e009c984ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,40,123,247,12,242,144,152,154,216,82,95,25,117,1,224,9,201,132,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
