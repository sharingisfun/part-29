The song was written by The Bee Gees' Barry, Maurice and Robin Gibb; with Barry Gibb's distinctive backing vocal being heard on the chorus. The unique brothers' sound can also be recognized in the syncopated rhythm of drums programming, the bright strings unisons and the powerful synthesizer brass sections.\n\nThe song peaked at #10 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in January 1983, and was a #1 Adult Contemporary hit [1]. In the UK, the track reached #2 for two weeks in November 1982. The tune was also a hit around the world.\n\nWarwick admitted in The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits by Wesley Hyatt that she was not fond of &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (regarding the song's international popularity, she quipped, &quot;I cried all the way to the bank&quot;), but recorded it because she trusted the Bee Gees' judgment that it would be a hit: it turned out to be Warwick's most successful solo hit of the 1980s. The Bee Gees recorded a version, with Barry Gibb on lead vocals which was featured on the album Their Greatest Hits: The Record as well as their Love Songs Album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba284a79cb778eea40d5fa9036b6d81ed83bcc07","amp;dn":"DIONNE+WARWICK+%281983%29+HEARTBREAKER.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba284a79cb778eea40d5fa9036b6d81ed83bcc07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,40,74,121,203,119,142,234,64,213,250,144,54,182,216,30,216,59,204,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
