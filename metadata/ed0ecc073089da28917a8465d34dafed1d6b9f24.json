No jumping is allowed. And shooting enemies is forbidden, but you can blast blocks to access lower platforms or trap pursuing enemies. Winding your way through ever-increasing levels of complexity makes for a superior challenge, but now you can choose to play any one of the 150 levels at any time.\n\nEXCITING NEW FEATURES\nAlthough the gameplay remains true to the original Apple II version, there are plenty of new features to enhance the experience, including options to magnify the screen around the Runner and set the play speed. Worldwide leaderboards track the top scores submitted from around the globe and you can choose to post your top scores on your Facebook wall to show off your old-school gaming chops.\n\n* Lode Runner Classic Features:\n\n- 150 puzzling levels Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all unlocked and accessible\n- Two game modes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Expedition and Time Attack\n- New magnification effect Ã¢â‚¬â€œ zoom the action around the Runner\n- Multiple play speeds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ super slow to superfast action\n- Fully adjustable color palettes\n- Worldwide leaderboards\n- Multiple control schemes\n- Illustrated How to Play section\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- Lode Runner is now MOGA Enhanced!
