The countdown doesn't stop until we get to our new number one best seller.&quot;\n\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThe band Kansas has its very first chart hit, &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; (at number 36) and Elvis Presley has his 133rd top 40 hit.\n\nA listener wants to know if there has ever been a group that hit number one, split up, and then had one of its ex-members hit number one. Casey says one group has had each of its members hit number one since its split, and gives the details.\n\nThere is a hit by a group who scored a chart first. In the 32 year history of the album chart, their album was the first ever to hit number one after being on the chart for an entire year.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;How many novelty songs in the rock era have hit number one, and which has been the biggest?&quot; He says the top three contenders are a witch-doctor, a duck, and a chipmunk.\n\nThere is a band in the countdown where one member nearly electrocuted himself onstage during a show, but insisted the show continue and was playing again ten minutes later.\n\nFinally, Casey recounts the origins of the popular television show, &quot;American Bandstand.&quot;\n\n40:    In The Mood - Henhouse Five Plus Two\n39:    Moody Blue - Elvis Presley\n38:    Rich Girl - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates        \n37:    I Like To Do It - K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band     \n36:    Carry On Wayward Son - Kansas     \n35:    The Things We Do For Love - 10 Cc    \n34:    Livin' Thing - Electric Light Orchestra\n33:    You've Got Me Runnin' - Gene Cotton\n32:    Living Next Door To Alice - Smokie\n31:    Stand Tall - Burton Cummings\n30:    Tonight's The Night (Gonna Be Alright) - Rod Stewart\n29:    Saturday Night - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire    \n28:    Go Your Own Way - Fleetwood Mac\n27:    Save It For A Rainy Day - Stephen Bishop\n26:    Don't Leave Me This Way - Thelma Houston\n25:    Boogie Child - Bee Gees\n24:    After The Lovin' - Englebert Humperdinck\n23:    You Don't Have To Be A Star (To Be In My Show) - Marilyn McCoo &amp; Billy Davis\n22:    Night Moves - Bob Seger\n21:    Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n20:    Year Of The Cat - Al Stewart\n19:    Dancing Queen - ABBA\n18:    Hard Luck Woman - Kiss\n17:    Jeans On - David Dundas\n16:    Somebody To Love - Queen\n15:    You Make Me Feel Like Dancing - Leo Sayer\n14:    Weekend In New England - Barry Manilow\n13:    Fly Like An Eagle - The Steve Miller Band\n12:    I Like Dreamin' - Kenny Nolan\n11:    Lost Without Your Love - Bread\n10:    Walk This Way - Areosmith\n9:    Enjoy Yourself - The Jacksons\n8:    I Wish - Stevie Wonder\n7:    Love Theme From &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (Evergreen) - Barbra Streisand\n6:    Blinded By The Light - Manfred Mann's Earth Band\n5:    Hot Line - Sylvers\n4:    New Kid In Town - The Eagles\n3:    Dazz - Brick\n2:    Car Wash - Rose Royce\n1:    Torn Between Two Lovers - Mary MacGregor\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24cf7dd770043b95768c910ea0f4c88baa173942","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1977_February_5th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24cf7dd770043b95768c910ea0f4c88baa173942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,207,125,215,112,4,59,149,118,140,145,14,160,244,200,139,170,23,57,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
