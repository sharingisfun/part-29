I realize that I got almost nothing to add. Everything is in here. \nIndisputably, nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°1 : Power of Omens is my fave band, allying huge technicalamity &amp; musicianship with great songwriting. I never understood how could one consider their music as a demonstration of nothing. Musicianship &amp; composition are the key words for most of these tracks. \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°2 : ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchemoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Garden Wall, band from (almost) one guy that succeeded in coming from prog into post-rock. \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°3, Continuo Renacer is an amazing spanish band, for incredible instrumental progressive riffing and harmonizing. Maybe a one shot, but fucking amazing. \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°4 : Extreme, the best of glam rock, when a great frontman is linked with ... (hey... you know) Nuno... as it best. \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°5 : that album of Sadist is always mentioned as a masterpiece by which who knows it. Lack of success, etc. And Sadist stayed in the UG. \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°6 : ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCivil WarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is probably my favorite POPULAR song written that succeeded in going mainstream. Great great track from the Guns at their best. \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°7 : DT : ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpull me underÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the beginning of prog metal... Feeling &amp; musicianship, I already spoke ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“bout that. A definitive masterpiece for everyone, and should be too for the death metal fans. \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°8 : Meshuggah ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œElasticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the last track from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChaosphereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, that one was very easy to choose thanx to the finish of that song with the superposition of x lines (and maybe the superposition of three songs or three times the same one with a time delay, simply just the apocalypse after a long note close to a flat EEG. \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°9 : Metallica. What else ? \nNÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°10 : Watchtower. One of the most huge revolution in thrash &amp; technical metal. Just a masterpiece, close to the edge of that era, but though ahead of time.\nAnd so on... \n\nEnjoy, listen... And SEED ! \n\nI hope you took a close look at everything, that you discovered fucking great bands that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll follow, and that you took a second though about the true essence of metal (which is crossing boundaries, INTRA &amp; INTER the limits and genres. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66285a2fd9b82878fe32565347aeef7df9dc7bbb","amp;dn":"METAL+TOP+1000+PART+1-100","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66285a2fd9b82878fe32565347aeef7df9dc7bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,40,90,47,217,184,40,120,254,50,86,83,71,174,239,125,249,220,123,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
