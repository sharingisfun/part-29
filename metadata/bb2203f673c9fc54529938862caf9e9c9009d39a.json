The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb2203f673c9fc54529938862caf9e9c9009d39a","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_05+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb2203f673c9fc54529938862caf9e9c9009d39a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,34,3,246,115,201,252,84,82,153,56,134,44,175,158,156,144,9,211,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
