The Anatomy of National Holiday\n\nDocumentary\nStuio Subjektiv Filma, 2005\n\nRunning time: 62 minutes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Language: Latvian\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Subtitles: English, Russian, Latvian\n\nScript: Askolds Saulitis\nDirector: Askolds Saulitis\nCinematographers: Andris PriedÃ„Â«tis, Haralds Vecvagars, Mikus Meirans\nEditor: Liene Balina\nComposer &amp; Sound: Janis Brunovskis\nProducer: Askolds Saulitis\n\nThrough expresssive poetic cinematography this film offers a Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½poemÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the hundreds of worker-bees behind the annual celebrations of Latvian proclamation on November 18th in the year 2004.Anniversary of National proclamation is a day of special meaning in all calendars in the whole world. Speeches and smiles, whispers and racy jokes swirl around. The Anatomy of National Holiday doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t claim to do a journalistic documentary research about solidarity of state power and society in such public holiday. With itsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ precise and expressive cinematographic means it is rather a poem about hundreds of pixies who arrange this festivity for us. It is poetry about Ã¢â‚¬Å¾back-yardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of holiday-making that everyone wants to look into. The film is a kind of holiday ecology: when our smaller brothers are sacrificed for our ritual dining table; when for a moment fireworks cover the real stars. It is a usual day in an unusual date Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 18th November 2004, the Latvian National Proclamation day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f59d40c98ac7a4065ac264850f2cfc2c38f415","amp;dn":"Sv%C4%93tku+anatomija+%282005%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f59d40c98ac7a4065ac264850f2cfc2c38f415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,245,157,64,201,138,199,164,6,90,194,100,133,15,44,252,44,56,244,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
