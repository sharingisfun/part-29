In it, John Wayne found one of his greatest roles, as an embittered, tyrannical Texas rancher whose tensions with his independent-minded adopted son - played by Montgomery Clift, in a breakout performance - reach epic proportions during a cattle drive to Missouri. The film is based on a novel that dramatizes the real-life late nineteenth-century expeditions along the Chisholm Trail, but Hawks is less interested in historical accuracy than in tweaking the codes of masculinity that propel the myths of the American West. The unerringly macho Wayne and the neurotic, boyish Clift make for an improbably perfect pair, held aloft by a quick-witted, multlayered screenplay and Hawks's formidable direction.\n\n\n-\nSize: 32.10 GB\n\nthanks to BT1080HD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6687b8f69ee607cd03d32074493a2709032318c","amp;dn":"Red+River+1948+1080p+Remux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6687b8f69ee607cd03d32074493a2709032318c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,104,123,143,105,238,96,124,208,61,50,7,68,147,162,112,144,50,49,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
