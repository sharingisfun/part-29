Sydney Town\n\nThis set contains the best of Gary Shearston's long career as a songwriter and peformer, divided more or less into two eras: the 1970s through to 2001 both in the UK and Australia (CD-1), and the 1960s in Australia (CD-2). Features: Gary's worldwide hit of Cole Porter's I Get A Kick Out Of You (1974) and other material from the UK album Dingo; his own Sometime Lovin' - a hit in Australia (1966) and heard worldwide thanks to Peter, Paul &amp; Mary. The collection also includes Shopping On A Saturday, a country music favourite from 1990. Bonus material: two UK singles, notably a fabulous version of Procul Harum's A Whiter Shade Of Pale (1975). Three Australian folksongs from the 1960s - never before heard outside the studio - are released here for the first time (Stirling-O, The Olde Viceroy, John Mitchell). In all, there are two and a half hours of music, a total of 42 tracks of Gary Shearston\n \n\nTECHNICAL NOTES\nDisc One is Stereo.
