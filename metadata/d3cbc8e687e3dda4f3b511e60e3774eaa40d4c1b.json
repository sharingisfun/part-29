I'm speechless. \n\nAs for what I did, a few hard line frequencies needed to be controlled, then slightly enhanced and maximized. \n\nAs for why I did it, the ultimate hope of having it be even more enjoyable for me to listen to. It is indeed. \n\nAs for sharing, that's for you to decide.\n\n\n\n01 Fat Old Sun            15:29\n02 One Of These Days       7:31\n03 Echoes                 26:35\n04 Embryo                 10:05\n05 Blues                   4:56\n\n\n\nPRE-13 SOURCE INFO\n====================\n====================\n\nHere it is, the infamous Meddled ROIO, feverishly sought after by\nFloyd fans wanting to hear what Meddler was supposed to sound like\nbefore being mistakenly editted to mono.\n\nIt came from an FM broadcast over the BBC in England.  The stereo\ndimension adds so much to the recording, you can actually hear very\ndistinctly what each band member is doing.  \n\nThis ROIO is just an incredible listen from start to finish.  The \nsound is amazing as is the performance of the Floyd.  Fat Old Sun\nnever sounded better.  It is important to note, Embryo and Blues\ncame from a different original source I believe.  You can read all\nabout this title (and Meddler) at the following URL: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pf-roio.de/roio/roio-cd/meddler.cd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pf-roio.de/roio/roio-cd/meddler.cd.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nOne of the best Floyd ROIO's ever made, bar none.  Sit back with a \nnice big fat one and enjoy the music.\n\n****************************************************\nTHANKS TO PINK FLOYD FOR THEIR SUPPORT\nOF AUDIENCE RECORDING,SHARING, AND TRADING.\nPLEASE SPREAD, BUT PLEASE \nINCLUDE SOURCE INFO.
