In the early 1960s, Harris and drummer Tony Meehan created sweeping soundscapes of infinite grandeur and exquisite beauty. Combining elements of pop, rock, surf, and even folk, they brought the rhythm section into the lead, while scoring several chart hits along the way.\n\nBoth men started out as members of The Shadows, backing up British pop icon Cliff Richard. It was once they stepped out from The Shadows, however, that they truly came into their own. From the very first single in 1962, a devastating rendition of the Latin classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBesame Mucho,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the duo proved to be a dynamic one indeed. Harris let his bass speak the melody and the result was spine tingling. The B-side featured a restrained but effective Harris vocal on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChills and Fever.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Although Harris was frequently dismissive of his singing abilities, his less is more approach provided a tension that was unique, especially on a talky reading of the Jerry Lee Lewis hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWild One (Real Wild Child).ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Harris didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need Jerry Lee pyrotechnics. He was on fire by definition.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Man With The Golden ArmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSome PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was, not surprisingly, a double-sided hit, considering the sheer ferocity of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the charming, finger-snapping hook of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPeople.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Equally catchy were the dance ditties ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œClap Your Hands (Once Again)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRave.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The latter packed as much punch as Bo DiddleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best, thanks to Harris and MeehanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s electrifying call and response approach.\n\nOn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œApplejack,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a folksy, downhome number was transformed into the soundtrack for a sleek and ultra-hip nightclub. That old brown jug became a martini glass and hillbillies kicked up their heels and really tore it down. One of the unreleased tracks on this disc, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Lonesome Part Of Town,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was also quite evocative, bordering on the cinematic. The laid back beat, coupled with a ragged, world weary vocal, called up images of cold, empty streets and gently shimmering streetlamps. The other unreleased track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAgain,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was a jaunty head-bobber, totally irresistible and immediately memorable.\n\nThe single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDiamondsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ backed with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFootstompÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ actually knocked The Shadows out of the top spot on the charts, and featured a young Jimmy Page on rhythm guitar. The appropriately named ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDiamondsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was an instrumental jewel of almost blinding brilliance, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFootstompÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was an infectious vocal number with the kind of hook that grabbed hold and never let go.\n\nAll of the Harris and Meehan material is, in fact, hard to shake. These two lads had a way with a rhythm that was mesmerizing. Every tune on this 20-track collection is, as the title suggests, a true gem.  Reviewed by Michael Macomber\n\nTracklist:\n01.
