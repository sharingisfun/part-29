Roddy Walston and the Business.\n\nV : H264 640x360 @ 29.97 fps\nA : AAC 2.0\nS : SubRip Closed Captioning\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nHow do I extract the subtitles :\nThe FLV container format usually contains a video and audio stream (x264 and aac in this case), which means I can easily extract them with &quot;FLV Extract&quot;. But in the FLV files from teamcoco.com, the container also includes an additional text stream (with the code TX3G). It's composed of Adobe ActionScript packages, which are used to transmit the text, 2 characters at a time, to the Flash player. I haven't found a program that can extract this, so I did one myself. What it does is :\n- Read the header of the FLV file to get the size for the packages of the different streams\n- Read the FLV file package by package, isolating the subtitles packages\n- Process the subtitles by recreating CC-like subtitles in SubRip format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7408af16768d7a5f1a2534ed0dcfe5b4f680a417","amp;dn":"Conan.2014.02.04.Ted.Danson.WEBRIP.x264-TeamCoCo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7408af16768d7a5f1a2534ed0dcfe5b4f680a417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,8,175,22,118,141,122,95,26,37,52,237,13,207,229,180,246,128,164,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
