With many fearing a nuclear retaliation from Israel, their mission was to find and destroy the source of the missiles being fired.  But the operation went spectacularly wrong.  The SAS force was discovered and attacked.  Some of the men were killed while others tried to escape by walking 200 miles across the Iraqi desert.  Esscentially abandoned, the men were left to fend for themeselves, deep inside Iraq.\n\nFor the first time, retired USAF General Charles Horner reveals why the men of the Bravo Two Zero Patrol were sent on their perilous mission and surviving members of the team Cpl. Chris Ryan and Sgt. Andy McNab, recall their harrowing ordeal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9992e1142231bb4bd6ce8cf5937176d218944410","amp;dn":"Military+History+-+SAS+Behind+Iraqi+Lines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9992e1142231bb4bd6ce8cf5937176d218944410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,146,225,20,34,49,187,75,214,206,140,245,147,113,118,210,24,148,68,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
