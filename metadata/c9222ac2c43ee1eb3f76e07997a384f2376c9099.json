The show differs from other prank television programs in that the stars of Impractical Jokers do not know the details of the prank until the moment they are performing it on strangers. While one cast-member performs the prank, the other three comedians in the troupe are behind the scenes feeding lines to their friend via microphone(with an earpiece). The lines fed to the prankster are meant to create a humorous &amp; awkward exchange between the prankster and the stranger being pranked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9222ac2c43ee1eb3f76e07997a384f2376c9099","amp;dn":"impractical+jokers+season+1+episodes+1+-+17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9222ac2c43ee1eb3f76e07997a384f2376c9099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,34,42,194,196,62,225,235,63,118,224,121,151,163,132,242,55,108,144,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
