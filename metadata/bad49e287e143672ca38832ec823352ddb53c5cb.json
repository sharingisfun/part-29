The Australian Pink Floyd Show is a live touring sensation which has now sold over three million tickets worldwide. Emerging back in 1988, the original and credible Floyd act TAPFS has been getting bigger and better ever since. The band were described by Floyd drummer Nick Mason on BBC 5 Live as &quot;Very good, probably better than we are,&quot; and even engaged by David Gilmour to perform at his 50th birthday celebration! The Mirror hailed the act quite simply as, &quot;The kings of the genre&quot;. The Australian Pink Floyd Show have also been described by Sunday Times as &quot;The best tribute band in the world&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 Shine On You Crazy Diamond 1-5\n02 Welcome To The Machine\n03 Coming Back To Life\n04 Arnold Layne\n05 Sorrow\n06 Learning To Fly\n07 Dogs\n08 Speak To Me\n09 Breathe\n10 On The Run\n11 Time\n12 Breathe (Reprise)\n13 The Great hGig In The Sky\n14 What Do You Want From Me\n15 Careful With That Axe Eugene\n16 Money\n17 The Happiest Days Of Our Lives\n18 Another Brick In The Wall - Part 2\n19 Wish You Were Here\n22 Run Like Hell\n20 One Of These Days\n21 Comfortably Numb\n\n\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFile size                                : 12.0 GiB\nDuration                                 : 2h 30mn\n\nVideo\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;531b3a343b131f677d62&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate                                 : 9 896 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                                   : 1 080 pixels\nLanguage                                 : English\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : DTS\nFormat/Info                              : Digital Theater Systems\nCodec ID                                 : A_DTS\nBit rate                                 : 1 510 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 6 channels\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bad49e287e143672ca38832ec823352ddb53c5cb","amp;dn":"The+Australian+Pink+Floyd+Show%3A+Live+At+The+Hammersmith+Apollo+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bad49e287e143672ca38832ec823352ddb53c5cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,212,158,40,126,20,54,114,202,56,131,46,200,35,53,45,219,83,197,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
