A Dime Away From a Hotdog\n2. Walk Away\n3. Feel the Fire\n4. A Ladiesman\n5. No Place to be Somebody\n6. To Stay in Good With You\n7. Gang Bang\n8. First Lady\n9. Young Man\n\nThe multitalented Oscar Brown Jr. (1926 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2005) was better known as a poet, playwright, nightclub performer, and civil-rights activist, but also recorded a dozen or so albums. Of those, about half were live recordings of his nightclub performances or plays. Among the rest, 1972's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Movin' OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was his most successful, thanks largely to the minor R&amp;B hit single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Ladiesman.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That album is presented here as re-issued 2002 by Atlantic Records under their Ã¢â‚¬Å“CollectablesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ label.\n\nDagosto's own take: Here Brown ventures into Damon Runyon territory and not only makes himself at home but also becomes king of all he surveys. With chuckling slyness he addresses issues ranging from  poverty (Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Dime Away From a HotdogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to romantic love (Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Stay in Good With YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and renders observations, not judgments. Largely absent are any pointed political statements; even Ã¢â‚¬Å“First LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tells of a fellow who wants to be elected President solely so that others will recognize his gal as the best in the land (1972 was an election year). There are some side comments: &quot;The president said, don't feel depressed/But his car ain't been repossessed.&quot; Mostly though Brown comes off as a grizzled but friendly uncle, offering frank advice in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walk AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Ladiesman.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The music is jazzy blues with a slightly gritty edge and a finger-snapping beat. In short, it's cooler than cool, a perfect compliment to Brown's beatnik-style lyrics. It's also quite sophisticated; listen carefully to the guitar chord progression used in Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Ladiesman.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ On the whole, it's that rare album of sonic unity rather than simply this year's aggregate of songs. \n\nAll files are presented in .mp3 format at 256 kb/sec","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad97d5ebacfed6c318a3b68f6ee683ed15c55b89","amp;dn":"Oscar+Brown+Jr.+-+Movin%27+On+%28US+Release%29+%5B1972%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad97d5ebacfed6c318a3b68f6ee683ed15c55b89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,151,213,235,172,254,214,195,24,163,182,143,110,230,131,237,21,197,91,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
