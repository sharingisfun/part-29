In 1963, they decided to form another little rock group -- they became the famed Guess Who. By 1970, though the Guess Who were still alive and kicking, Bachman and Allen turned their attention to a new rock outlet, Brave Belt. Other members were bassist and vocalist Fred Turner and drummer Robin Bachman. After the completion of one album, and only a little work on a second, Allen left, and was replaced by guitarist Tim Bachman. Before a third offering was ready, Brave Belt folded into a new mortality, Bachman Turner Overdrive.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f3abae96c09fa7e5d348c3f840215e141250d3c","amp;dn":"Brave+Belt+-+Brave+Belt+I+%2B+II+%281970-72%2F2001%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f3abae96c09fa7e5d348c3f840215e141250d3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,58,186,233,108,9,250,126,93,52,140,63,132,2,21,225,65,37,13,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
