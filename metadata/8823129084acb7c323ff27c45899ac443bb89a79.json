Historian I. Bernard Cohen of Harvard University called Bernard &quot;one of the greatest of all men of science&quot;. Among many other accomplishments, he was one of the first to suggest the use of blind experiments to ensure the objectivity of scientific observations. He was the first to define the term milieu intÃƒÂ©rieur, now known as homeostasis.\n\nIn his major discourse on the scientific method, An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine (1865), Bernard described what makes a scientific theory good and what makes a scientist important, a true discoverer. Unlike many scientific writers of his time, Bernard wrote about his own experiments and thoughts, and used the first person.\n\nClear and penetrating presentation of the basic principles of scientific research from the great French physiologist whose contributions in the 19th century included the discovery of vasomotor nerves; nature of curare and other poisons in human body; functions of pancreatic juice in digestion; elucidation of glycogenic function of the liver.\n\nThis Dover edition, first published in 1957, is an unabridged and unaltered republication of the first English translation originally published in 1927 by\nMacmillan &amp; Co., Ltd.
