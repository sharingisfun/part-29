The Arms Dealer's Daughter basically picks up where Solar Shears left off in 2001, delivering a mixed bag of tunes and rhythms that hits the spot more than it misses. Things get off to a pleasant, but not really compelling, start with four sets of original tunes, mostly written by fiddler Angus R. Grant and mandolin/banjo/bouzouki player Luke Plumb. Of these, the most exciting is the set that includes the title track and the raucously joyful &quot;Aye Right.&quot; Then things really pick up and get interesting: the &quot;Nordal Rumba,&quot; with its percolating combination of fiddle, Afro-Cuban drumbeats, and rollicking horns, is some of the most fun music recorded in this century; on &quot;Maxine's Polka,&quot; the band dips into electronica textures and produces what may be the first junglist polka in the history of recorded Celtic music; &quot;Fistful of Euro&quot; is a dense and trip-hoppy fusion of Celtic and North African elements. &quot;Carboni's Farewell&quot; gets a bit too long-winded for its own good, but the energetic reel set &quot;Scraping the Barrel&quot; puts things back on solid footing again. Anyone with both a love of Celtic music and at least moderately adventurous ears will find much to enjoy on this album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d91e46eb10f218624d0e9c4787862d4765155faf","amp;dn":"Shooglenifty+-+The+Arms+Dealer%27s+Daughter+%5B2003%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d91e46eb10f218624d0e9c4787862d4765155faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,30,70,235,16,242,24,98,77,14,156,71,135,134,45,71,101,21,95,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
