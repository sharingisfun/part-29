ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why they call it the National Debt. All our money is created out of debt. Politicians who focus on reducing the National Debt as an answer probably donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what the National Debt really is. To reduce the National Debt would be to reduce our money ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s already too little of that.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo, you have to go deeper. You have to get at the root of this problem or weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re never going to fix this. The solution isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t new or radical. America used to do it. Politicians used to fight with big bankers over it. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all in our history ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ now sadly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in the distant past...&quot;\n\n\n\n\nPlease support the makers by purchasing an official DVD, by spreading the word about the movie, by making a donation on their web page, or by other means available to you. Thank you!\n\n*WARNING*:\nMovies Zeitgeist, Ring of power and many others are part of a anti-awakening  brainwash campaign on the internet. The Illuminati (or whatever their ultimate name be) speculate using semi-truth and suggest useless, if not negative, solutions, such as total rejection of the system and paradise in technology, for instance. They act like rats by blaming nations (e.g.Jews) and various religous, political and other social groups), produce fake specialists (for their movies in particualar) and 'geniuses' for downgrading our values and reason. Stay cautious and look for real-life solutions.\n\nThe Ill-luminati are retarded and immoral, and are only trying to bring us down to their level. Cheer up and get active!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe6b22bc48dfc3f683848c9803376fad6c7926c1","amp;dn":"The+Secret+of+Oz+%28the+revised+Money+Masters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe6b22bc48dfc3f683848c9803376fad6c7926c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,107,34,188,72,223,195,246,131,132,140,152,3,55,111,173,108,121,38,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
