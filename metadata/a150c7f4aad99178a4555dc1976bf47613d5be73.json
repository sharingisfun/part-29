Although many of the tracks present had been available on albums dating as far back as September 1964, the album did contain five new tracks *not* from the Vee-Jay vaults: Belle Stars, Funky Dish Rag, both instumentals probably cut in 1971, and Why Don't You Love Me?, recorded that same year; plus instrumental reworkings of Lucille and Keep A-Knockin'. Technically there was nothing &quot;new&quot; about the album (albeit long, stereo versions of very common sides) as it contained material over six years old, but the final release of the archived tracks, coupled with the tie-in to Jimi Hendrix as guitarist, meant that the release was a viable one.\n\n[Tracks 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12 Personnel include Little Richard (keyboards?); rest unknown (possibly a mix of Little Richard's 1970s touring band and contemporary studio musicians)].\n\nNote: &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; (instrumental) is actually &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; (instrumental).\n\n\nThis item has been discontinued by the manufacturer.\n\nPersonnel:\nDon Harris - Bass;\nDewey Terry, Jimi Hendrix - Guitar;\nLittle Richard - Piano, Vocals\n\nJimi Hendrix &amp; Little Richard - Friends From The Beginning Tracks:\n01  Whole Lotta Shakin'\n02  Goodnight Irene\n03  Keep a Knockin'\n04  Going Home Tomorrow\n05  Belle Stars [Piano Instrumental]\n06  Tutti Frutti\n07  Lawdy Miss Clawdy\n08  Why Don't You Love Me\n09  Lucille\n10  Hound Dog\n11  Money Honey\n12  Funky Dish Rag [Organ Instrumental]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a150c7f4aad99178a4555dc1976bf47613d5be73","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+%26+Little+Richard+-+Friends+From+The+Beginning+%281972","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a150c7f4aad99178a4555dc1976bf47613d5be73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,80,199,244,170,217,145,120,164,85,93,193,151,107,244,118,19,213,190,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
