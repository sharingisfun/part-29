The song's lyrics were taken from a comedy track from Sathyan Anthikad's film 1983 film Kinnaram, featuring Jagathy Sreekumar who played the role of a music composer in the film. The lyrics of the song is apparently the creation of the great actor himself. Additional lyrics were added by Shabareesh Varma. A music video was released in March 2013 and went viral. The video was directed by Alphonse Putharen who is also the director of the movie. \nThe song was a tribute to Jagathy Sreekumar, who had met with an accident just over a year before its release and is still in a serious state in the ICU.\n\nThis upload of mine is a tribute to him.
