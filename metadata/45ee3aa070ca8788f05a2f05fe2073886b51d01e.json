While investigating a mysterious organization, he was knocked unconscious by one of them, and an experimental poison was forced down his throat.

In order to prevent the men in black who did this to him from hurting his friends and family, he changed his name to [Edogawa Conan] and took on the identity of a gifted primary school student who solves mysteries and crimes through reasoning, logic, the help of his friends and some nifty gadgets Dr. [Agasa Hiroshi] invented for him. Now, he lives with his childhood friend, [Mouri Ran], and her father, detective [Mouri Kogorou], without them knowing about his situation, and carries on his investigation of the organization that is still out to kill him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45ee3aa070ca8788f05a2f05fe2073886b51d01e","amp;dn":"Detective+Conan+-+780+%28NTV+1280x720+x264+AAC%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45ee3aa070ca8788f05a2f05fe2073886b51d01e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,238,58,160,112,202,135,136,240,90,47,5,254,32,115,136,107,81,208,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
