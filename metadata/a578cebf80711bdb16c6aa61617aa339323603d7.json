During this period he charts the European craze for operas and music that dealt with death and destiny.\n\nHoward suggests that composers were inspired by Berlioz and his Symphonie Fantastique and that music written about witches, ghouls, trolls and hellish torment became the norm. Italian opera succumbed to the death and destiny obsession with VerdiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s La Traviata, whose tragic death of its heroine, he argues, was a comment on the hypocrisies of the wider society. Howard also notes how the age of the great composer emerged, and argues that the image of the composer as a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmisunderstood geniusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was cemented in the public imagination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a578cebf80711bdb16c6aa61617aa339323603d7","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Story+of+Music+Episode+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a578cebf80711bdb16c6aa61617aa339323603d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,120,206,191,128,113,27,219,22,198,170,97,97,122,163,57,50,54,3,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
