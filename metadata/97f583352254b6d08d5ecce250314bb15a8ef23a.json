Bands and artists that covered the legendary bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs include Wolfmother, Nickelback, Daughtry, Wyclef Jean, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Duff McKaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Loaded, Filter, Mastodon, Jamey Johnson and Coheed &amp; Cambia, according to Blabbermouth.\nYet, one of the most interesting contributors to the album, is a supergroup that was put together specifically for this tribute. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, the foundation of Fleetwood Mac, brought on guitar great Jonny Lang and superstar Steven Tyler to form The M.O.B. The band kicks off the compilation with their version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSharp Dressed Man.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re delighted to honor ZZ Top this way,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fleetwood said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTheir legacy, like that of the original Fleetwood Mac, is steeped in the blues we all love so much. I know that Steven and Jonny feel as strongly about their legacy as John and I do.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f583352254b6d08d5ecce250314bb15a8ef23a","amp;dn":"ZZ+Top+%26acirc%3B%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+A+Tribute+from+Friends+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f583352254b6d08d5ecce250314bb15a8ef23a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,245,131,53,34,84,182,208,141,94,204,226,80,49,75,177,90,142,242,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
