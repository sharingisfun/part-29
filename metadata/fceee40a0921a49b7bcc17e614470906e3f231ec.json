It featured Carlton Banks dancing &amp; Trent Reznor on a unicorn. The video was going viral until it was pulled down. Rumor has it that Trent was not a fan &amp; that he even blocked the person who made it on Facebook. I heard all of this via my NINternet friends online. Not entirely sure how much is true but regardless, here is the video for those who didn't get to see it! I ripped it straight from YouTube.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fceee40a0921a49b7bcc17e614470906e3f231ec","amp;dn":"NIN+Everything+funny+Unofficial+video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fceee40a0921a49b7bcc17e614470906e3f231ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,238,228,10,9,33,164,155,123,204,23,230,20,71,9,6,227,242,49,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
