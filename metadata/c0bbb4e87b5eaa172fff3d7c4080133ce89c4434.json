The late Alan Blanc had a lifetime's obsession with stairs and steps and provided a definitive reference source that bridges the aesthetic and practical aspects of staircase design. His wife Sylvia, who worked with him on the first edition, presents this updated, abridged version alongside a complimentary web site where the historical elements of the subjects are described and discussed in pictures and diagrams.\n\nThe book is a practical guide to designing circulation spaces. It is extensively detailed with working drawings and photographs. Construction methods using a variety of materials are discussed as well as the influence of new technology on vertical circulation. The guidance on codes and regulations covers the UK and US.
