Composed of recordings that Kaufman made on microcassette from 1977 to 1979, the album was created by several of Kaufman's friends as well as contemporary comedians.\n\nRecording:\n\nKaufman recorded over 80 hours of material with the intention of recording an album similar to Steve Allen and Jerry Lewis' prank call comedy recordsÃ¢â‚¬â€his tapes include explicit instructions on how the album should sound. Kaufman's girlfriend Lynn Marguiles kept the tapes for decades but never found the opportunity to release them until she published a 2009 book of letters sent to Kaufman and her publisher put her in touch with Drag City. The album was compiled by editor Rodney Ascher and comedian Vernon Chatman with narration between tracks by comedian Bill Hader and liner notes by Kaufman confidante Bob Zmuda. The album includes Kaufman's potential plans for faking his own deathÃ¢â‚¬â€a long-rumored prank that he has allegedly pulled on the public for over 30 years. Chatman is contractually barred from commenting on whether or not Kaufman in fact faked his death.\n\nTracklist:\n1.  Andy Is Making A Record - 1:38\n2.  Andy And His Grandmother - 1:14\n3.
