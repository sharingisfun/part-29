David Harrison's expeditions around the world to meet with last speakers of vanishing languages. The speakers' eloquent reflections and candid photographs reveal little-known lifeways as well as revitalization efforts to teach disappearing languages to younger generations. Thought-provoking and engaging, this unique book illuminates the global language-extinction crisis through photos, graphics, interviews, traditional wisdom never before translated into English, and first-person essays that thrillingly convey the adventure of science and exploration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309fe1aba2630262ce7a143de861b42e87b4ceae","amp;dn":"The+Last+Speakers+-+Harrison%2C+David+K+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+Mobi%2FEpub%2FPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309fe1aba2630262ce7a143de861b42e87b4ceae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,159,225,171,162,99,2,98,206,122,20,61,232,97,180,46,135,180,206,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
