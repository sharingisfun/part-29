First - it's the movie itself. Its quality is the best one,\nyou won't find anything better anywhere. And i tried to preserve this.\nSecond - a LOT of extras. In fact, a whole 2nd DVD is filled with these, namely -\ndeleted scenes, early drawings, deleted songs (including new versions of them!),\ninterviews etc. And these i riped too. Don't complain about quality - these extra\nmaterials were not meant to be of a good quality from the very beginning.\nMain movie and some extras come with subtitles.\n\nThanks to:\n  xela123","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d829316fd134b904f4f6ed634f400b4e5731348","amp;dn":"Aladdin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d829316fd134b904f4f6ed634f400b4e5731348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,130,147,22,253,19,75,144,79,79,110,214,52,244,0,180,229,115,19,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
