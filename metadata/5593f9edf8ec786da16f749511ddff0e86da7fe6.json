This was the \ndriving force behind a want to create an album including Australian characters from the 1920/30's era.\nAs producer (and bass player), Mitch Cairns, explains: &quot;To our knowledge, most &quot;Australiana&quot; characters have been\n portrayed in a traditional colonial folk sense, so we wanted to find a way to deliver the stories in a more mainstream \nvein whilst still placing them in a &quot;vintage era&quot;. A blues style seemed to be the perfect fit!! We tried to keep the\n vibe of the album raw and honest with lots of textural instruments and sounds, but above all, it had to be simple and\n spacious. We are also very honoured to have some very special guests on the album, including Troy Cassar-Daley, Mark\n Lizotte and Renee Geyer.&quot;\nThe album has stories about Australian characters such as champion racehorse Phar Lap (&quot;Big Red&quot;), boxing legend\n Les Darcy, The Dock Wars (&quot;Bout To Break&quot;), The Great Depression (&quot;Big House&quot;) and gangster Squizzy Taylor which \nare all moulded together in a melting pot of swinging shuffles and delta grooves! \n\n==============================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
