It was released by Atlantic Records on October 14, 1994. The long awaited reunion between Page and Plant occurred on a 90 minute \\&quot;UnLedded\\&quot; MTV project, recorded in Morocco, Wales, and London, which rated highly on network television. It was not a reunion of Led Zeppelin, however, as former bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones was not present. In fact, Jones was not even told about the reunion by his former band members. He later commented that he was unhappy about Plant and Page naming the album after \\&quot;No Quarter\\&quot;, a Led Zeppelin song which was largely his work.\n\nIn addition to acoustic numbers, the album features a reworking of Led Zeppelin classics, along with four Middle-Eastern and Moroccan-influenced songs: \\&quot;City Don\\&amp;#039;t Cry,\\&quot; \\&quot;Yallah,\\&quot; (or \\&quot;The Truth Explodes\\&quot;) \\&quot;Wonderful One,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Wah Wah\\&quot;.\n\nThe album was #4 on debut on the Billboard\\&amp;#039;s Pop Albums chart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ee2b56112be9411a3d0c854a9af3605fe244132","amp;dn":"Page+and+Plant+Unplugged+-+No+Quarter.DVDrip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ee2b56112be9411a3d0c854a9af3605fe244132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,226,181,97,18,190,148,17,163,208,200,84,169,175,54,5,254,36,65,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
