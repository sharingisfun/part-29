A big industry installs in town, changing the way and the culture of this small village.\n\n--\n\nIn the 60's, MÃƒÂ¡rio Carneiro and Paulo Saraceni presented the life of fishermen and workers in Arraial do Cabo, in Rio de Janeiro state. The speech of a leader of the union, the fishermen and the workers arriving to their daily journey and drinking before returning home are presented in this short.\n\nThis documentary is completely dated in the present days, since Arraial do Cabo was part of the civil construction boom of the last decades in Brazil, and presently is a place for spending weekends and vacations on the beach. However, this documentary shows the life style in the 60's, in a period where Brazilian &quot;Cinema Novo&quot; was beginning with an inner preoccupation of &quot;Who is the Brazilian Man&quot; and trying to find the &quot;real&quot; roots of the Brazilian men. I personally did not like this documentary, but I absolutely agree with its importance to the moment of the Brazilian cinema. My vote is five.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053608/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053608/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo \nCodec ID/Hint : XviD \nDuration : 17mn 28s \nBit rate : 1 323 Kbps \nWidth : 560 pixels \nHeight : 416 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 23.976 fps \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.237 \n\nAudio \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nNominal bit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:565251696c825d93011fd07b7b5899c9e0d3be6f","amp;dn":"Arraial+do+Cabo+-+1960+-+DVDRip+-+Short","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"565251696c825d93011fd07b7b5899c9e0d3be6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,82,81,105,108,130,93,147,1,31,208,123,123,88,153,201,224,211,190,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
