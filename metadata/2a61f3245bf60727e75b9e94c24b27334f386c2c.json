Solid tracks that stand their own. This month, I had to look very hard. Fortunately I found some nice and recent Indie music (Pop, Folk, Rock, Chill) which comes close.\n \nOne important source (thank you all) was late. So it took some time to finish part Two. Part One has been released two weeks agoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Enjoy.\n \nRemark:\nSomebody said Ã¢â‚¬Å“These are the best Indie Playlists aroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and I felt some resistance to call it best. But when I think about it; if you select all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tracks from all other playlists (plus), then you probably end up with something like the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of all Indie Playlists......... I would like to think that.\n \n(Specs are missing due to DB Errors)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a61f3245bf60727e75b9e94c24b27334f386c2c","amp;dn":"VA+Indie+Rock+Playlists+1209+Part+2+of+2+%28Dutch+Treat+HQ+VBR+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a61f3245bf60727e75b9e94c24b27334f386c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,97,243,36,91,246,7,39,231,91,158,148,194,75,39,51,79,56,108,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
