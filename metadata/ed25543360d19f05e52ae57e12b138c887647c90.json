Though research by these men led to great discovery, many were convinced that they were merely scratching the surface of an immense but lost pristine knowledge (prisca sapientia) somehow reflected in the architecture and remains of ancient civilizations.\n\nIn &quot;Temple at the Center of Time: Investigations of Sacred Dimension, Revealed in Prophecy, the Temple of Jerusalem, and the Ark of the Covenant, from the works of Isaac Newton&quot;, David Flynn uncovered what has been heralded as one of the greatest discoveries of all time.\n\nMany books have investigated whether Newton believed that an original pure knowledge existed. Some conclude that he did in fact search for it, but that is the whole of their investigation. A few have written that Newton actually discovered Ã¢â‚¬ËœsomethingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and try to fit his existing research into a prisca sapientia of their own design, claiming his beliefs fit modern realms of philosophy or eastern religions, but these speculations are not upheld by the body of his work. Although Newton had solved riddles of space, time, gravity, light and invented mathematics to predict the motion of objects, this was not the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpriscia sapientaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Since the time of Newton, no one has revealed the true form and nature of the original knowledge, or from whence it cameÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ until now.\n\nFor the first time in history, &quot;Temple at the Center of Time&quot; uncovers what Newton was looking for and, in so doing, proves that pivotal events in history are unquestionably connected in time and space to Jerusalem.\n\nNewton didn't know it. The key was right in front of him!\n\n\n-CYDONIA: The Secret Chronicles of Mars\n* the great Cosmic Clock embodied in the Ouroboros, and the true meaning of this serpentine symbol\n* the &quot;gods&quot; who ruled the planets in the ages before Adam - (Pre Adamic History) - and their return as &quot;aliens&quot;\n* the distinctly Martian influence on human civilization from earliest times to the present\n*the meaning behind the esoteric tenet &quot;As Above, So Below&quot;\n* the Great Work of the Mystery Schools from its point of origin to the implementation by the modern alchemists of NASA.\n\nAbout the author:\nThe author of Cydonia: The Secret Chronicles of Mars, wrote popular articles on Mars and of the Biblical significance of the Cydonian Monuments for years. His decidedly alternative views on Cydonia have been discussed on the PAX Television program &quot;Encounters: What is Really on Mars,&quot; also featuring Richard C. Hoagland, the researcher who popularized the Pyramids and Sphinx-face found in NASA images of the surface of Cydonia Mars on his website www.enterprisemission.com, on the Coast to Coast AM show, and in his own book The Monuments of Mars.\n\nDavid was always a popular guest on topics such as: the Monuments on Mars; the meaning behind the Sphinx symbol and Biblical cherubim, as well as UFOs &amp; the Nephilim or &quot;aliens&quot;.\n\nDave's research on the Watcher Website has been featured on &quot;Strange Universe&quot;, among other shows, and was used as a resource by Dr. Mark Eastman who co-wrote the bestselling 1996 UFOs and Genesis 6-themed book Alien Encounters with popular Christian researcher Chuck Missler.\n\nDavid Eric Flynn, 49, died January 22, 2012 after a short battle with cancer at his home in Helena. Dave was born October 29, 1962 in Chicago, Illinois to Dr. Alan and Marjorie Flynn. He attended Helena High School and graduated from the University of Montana.
