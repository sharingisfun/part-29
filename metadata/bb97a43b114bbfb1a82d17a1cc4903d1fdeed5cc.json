Following the death of the grandmother who raised them, sisters Marina, Sofia and Violeta live alone in their family home, each trying to deal with her absence in their own way. Marina buries herself in her studies, while also taking care of the house; Sofia concentrates on her appearance and material possessions; and Violeta wanders from her bedroom to the living room, receiving occasional visits from an older man. This period of transition and uncertainty is marked by disagreements, laughter, mean remarks and affectionate gestures, until one autumn day Violeta suddenly disappears without a word.\n\nAwards\n2011: Mar de Plata Film Festival: Best Film and Best Director\n2011: Locarno International Film Festival: Best Film, Director and Actress\n\nYear: 2011\nRunning Time: 99 min.\nCountry: Argentina\nDirector: Milagros Mumenthaler\nCast: Maria Canale, Martina Juncadella, AilÃƒÂ­n Salas and Julian Tello\n\n\nAbrir.puertas.y.ventanas.2011.DVDrip.x264-DoKtor\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile size: 853 MiB\nWidth: 1 280 pixels\nHeight: 688 pixels\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\nAudio format: AAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb97a43b114bbfb1a82d17a1cc4903d1fdeed5cc","amp;dn":"Abrir.puertas.y.ventanas.2011.DVDrip.x264-DoKtor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb97a43b114bbfb1a82d17a1cc4903d1fdeed5cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,151,164,59,17,75,191,177,168,45,23,161,204,73,3,209,253,238,213,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
