It's one of his best albums and is a return to form after the film soundtrack La Passione and the more electronic sounds of The Road to Hell Part 2. Written primarily during a vacation in the Turks and Caicos Islands, it's replete with lots of beach and summer imagery in the titles (&quot;King of the Beach,&quot; &quot;All Summer Long,&quot; &quot;Sandwriting,&quot; &quot;Sail Away&quot;) as well as the lyrics, which were originally written as poems. A remix of &quot;All Summer Long&quot; was a big dance hit in Ibiza and other Mediterranean hot spots. A good album for a summer day, with a soulful mellowness flowing through the tracks. ~ Rob Caldwell, All Music\nGuide\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n\n\n\n01. King of the Beach (5:02)\n02.
