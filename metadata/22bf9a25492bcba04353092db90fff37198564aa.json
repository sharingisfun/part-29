The year is 1969. An ancient ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\ncurse has spilled over into the world of the ordinary ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\niving, with werewolves, vampires, and zombies shedding ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\nbucketloads of blood. In short, Tristan (our vampire) is ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\nnot a bad guy despite his undead status, and he was in ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\nlove with a girl named Lucy. Tristan's former wife, the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\ndaughter of the Devil, doesn't take the news of Tristan's ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\nlove affair with Lucy very well, and she curses Lucy to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\nbecome a ravenous werewolf roaming the Earth for all ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\neternity...that is, unless a silver bullet pierces her ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\nheart and kills her. Lucy's death brings the daughter of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½\nthe Devil back from Hell.\n\n\nSOURCE: NTSC - AC3 2-CH\nViDEO: XViD 592 x 336 - 997 kbps\nAUDiO: English / AC3 2-CH 192kbps\niNFO: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242605\nGENRE: Horror\nRUNTiME: 01:22:00\nSiZE: 700mb ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22bf9a25492bcba04353092db90fff37198564aa","amp;dn":"Blood.Moon.Rising.2009.DVDRip.XViD-DOCUMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22bf9a25492bcba04353092db90fff37198564aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,191,154,37,73,43,203,160,67,83,9,45,185,15,255,55,25,133,100,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
