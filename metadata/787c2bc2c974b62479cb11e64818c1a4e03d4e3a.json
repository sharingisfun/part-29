Today, at over seventy years old, she continues to take care of Roger (Andy Lau), the only member of the family left in Hong Kong. After suffering a stroke at home one day, Tao realizes it's about time she retired, so she asks Roger to find her a nursing home for rehabilitation. Tao struggles to adjust to the strange new environment as well as her eccentric fellow inmates, but Roger is there to care for this mother figure who has devoted her life to his.\n\nSource:Blu-Ray\n \nRip Specs General \n \nComplete name : A Simple Life.2011.BDRip.AC3.x264-LooKMaNe.mkv \nFormat : Matroska \nFormat version : Version 2 \nFile size : 1.80 GiB \nDuration : 1h 58mn \nOverall bit rate : 2 177 Kbps \nEncoded date : UTC 2012-06-21 00:31:18 \nWriting application : mkvmerge v5.6.0 ('Kenya Kane') built on May 27 2012 16:44:04 \nWriting library : libebml v1.2.3 + libmatroska v1.3.0 \n\nUpped KG: trapstar\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:787c2bc2c974b62479cb11e64818c1a4e03d4e3a","amp;dn":"A+Simple+Life.2011.BDRip.AC3.x264-LooKMaNe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"787c2bc2c974b62479cb11e64818c1a4e03d4e3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,124,43,194,201,116,182,36,121,203,17,230,72,24,193,164,224,61,78,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
