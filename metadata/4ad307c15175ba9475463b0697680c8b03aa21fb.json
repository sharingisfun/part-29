The release includes all three sets from the band's December 31, 1999/January 1, 2000 New Year's Eve show at the Roxy Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The band had headlined the same venue exactly one year before, which resulted in their second live album Live... With a Little Help from Our Friends. Unlike that release, which came out within a year of the actual concert, Mulennium was not released until 2010.\n\nMulennium [320k MP3]\n\n\nCD 1\n\n   01. &quot;Bad Little Doggie&quot; (Haynes/Woody) - 4:46\n   02. &quot;Lay Your Burden Down&quot; (Haynes/Barbiero) - 5:07\n   03. &quot;Blind Man in the Dark&quot; (Haynes) - 7:35\n   04. &quot;Life Before Insanity&quot; (Haynes/Louis) - 7:16\n   05. &quot;Larger than Life&quot; (Haynes) - 6:08\n   06. &quot;Towering Fool&quot; (Haynes/Abts) - 8:20\n   07. &quot;Countdown Jam&quot; (Haynes/Woody/Abts) - 1:34\n   08. &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; (Fripp/Giles/Lake/McDonald/Sinfield) - 6:15\n   09. &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; (Townshend) - 3:52\n   10. &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (Page) - 11:47\n\nCD 2\n\n   01. &quot;When the Blues Come Knockin'&quot; (Haynes/Jaworowicz) - 5:54\n   02. &quot;My Dog and Me&quot; (Campbell) - 10:17\n   03. &quot;Lump on Your Stump&quot; (Campbell) - 7:56\n   04. &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot; (Dixon) - 11:38\n   05. &quot;It Hurts Me Too&quot; (Sehorn) - 10:10\n   06. &quot;Blues is Alright&quot; (Campbell) - 8:17\n   07. &quot;Is It My Body?&quot; (Bruce/Buxton/Cooper/Dunaway/Smith) - 5:30\n   08. &quot;Power of Soul&quot; (Hendrix) - 13:27\n\nCD 3\n\n   01. &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (Lennon/McCartney) - 3:44\n   02. &quot;Sometimes Salvation&quot; (Robinson/Robinson) - 4:08\n   03. &quot;30 Days in the Hole&quot; (Marriott) - 6:27\n   04. &quot;End of the Line&quot; (Allman/Haynes/Jaworowicz/Woody) - 9:00\n   05. &quot;Out of the Rain&quot; (White) - 11:13\n   06. &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; (Dylan) - 11:07\n   07. &quot;Simple Man&quot; (Rossington/Van Zant) - 15:44\n   08. &quot;Crowd&quot; - 1:46\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTES:\n\n&quot;Bad Little Doggie&quot; begins, as many Mule shows have over the years, with the stage introduction by Kirk West, longtime Allman Brothers Band roadie and &quot;tour mystic.&quot; West's spiel this time out is a bit involved, both in terms of what he has to say and the way in which the band's riffing fits in with it.\n\n&quot;Countdown Jam&quot; was played while the band was waiting to count down to midnight. &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man,&quot; which followed as the new year began, was chosen to usher in the new millennium.\n\nDuring stage banter between songs, Milton informs the crowd that it was Haynes who provided the idea for the title of Milton's album released earlier that year, Welcome to Little Milton.\n\nThis concert was the first time that Gov't Mule had played the following songs in concert: &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot;, &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot;, &quot;My Dog And Me&quot;, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and &quot;Sometimes Salvation&quot;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGov't Mule\n\nWarren Haynes - guitar, vocals\nAllen Woody - bass, mandolin\nMatt Abts - drums, percussion\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nAudley Freed - guitar (CD 2 tracks 7 and 8, all of CD 3)\nRobert Kearns - percussion, bass, vocals (CD 3 tracks 3 and 6)\nLittle Milton - guitar, vocals (CD 2 tracks 1 - 6)\nJohnny Mosier - guitar (CD 3 tracks 5 and 6)\nBarry Richman - guitar (CD 3 track 6)\nMark van Allen - pedal steel (CD 3 tracks 5 - 7)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ad307c15175ba9475463b0697680c8b03aa21fb","amp;dn":"Gov%5C%27t+Mule+-+Mulennium+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ad307c15175ba9475463b0697680c8b03aa21fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,211,7,193,81,117,186,148,117,70,59,6,151,104,12,139,3,170,33,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
