Along with prevailing riffs and lyrics of imagery, The Botanist brings to the table a psychedelic/stranded sense of rock with a flavorful hint at sex and devilish nature. The self-produced debut EP ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAbout GhostsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ containing vocals captured in a closet under a set of stairs was released on Mardi Gras 2010 and will provide the basis for what is to come. \n\nwww.thebotanist.net\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:789b2dfdb9721c2f48d01616122211957888c41e","amp;dn":"The+Botanist+-+About+Ghosts+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"789b2dfdb9721c2f48d01616122211957888c41e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,155,45,253,185,114,28,47,72,208,22,22,18,34,17,149,120,136,196,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
