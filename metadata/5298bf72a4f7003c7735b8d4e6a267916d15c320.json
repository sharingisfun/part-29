The first edition was completed by Volume 12 which closed in AD 324. The editors of the new edition have enlarged the scope of Volume 12 to include the foundation of Constantinople and the death of Constantine, and extended the series with two new volumes taking the history down to AD 600. Volume 13 covers the years 337-425, from the death of Constantine to the reign of Theodosius II. It begins with a series of narrative chapters, followed by a part on government and institutions. The economy and society of the Empire are grouped together, as are chapters on foreign relations and the barbarian world. A part on religion marks the importance of Christianity in the Roman Empire by this period. The volume concludes with chapters on the various literary cultures of the Empire, and on art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5298bf72a4f7003c7735b8d4e6a267916d15c320","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Ancient+History+Vol+13+-+The+Late+Empire%2C+A.D.+337","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5298bf72a4f7003c7735b8d4e6a267916d15c320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,152,191,114,164,247,0,60,119,53,184,212,230,162,103,145,109,21,195,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
