She determines to take revenge upon the men responsible for the death of her father in the first film.  \n\nIn a rural French village an old man and his only remaining relative are successful flower growers using water from a spring on an adjoining property they now own. The grown-up daughter of the previous owner still lives in the hills as a goatherd and comes to realise that not only these two but the whole village knew of the existence of the spring when her father was desperately trying to water his crops. An accident with one of the goats leads her by chance to the source of the spring and the possibility of a terrible revenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae1c48ef8630559d04d3146e8002768969a4249","amp;dn":"Manon+des+sources","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae1c48ef8630559d04d3146e8002768969a4249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,225,196,142,248,99,5,89,208,77,49,70,232,0,39,104,150,154,66,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
