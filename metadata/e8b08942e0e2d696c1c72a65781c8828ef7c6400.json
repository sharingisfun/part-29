His wife Mariamma stretches their money, raises their two boys, and, in her spare time, gleefully fantasizes about Ousep dying. One day, their seemingly happy seventeen-year-old son UnniÃ¢â‚¬â€an obsessed comic-book artistÃ¢â‚¬â€falls from the balcony, leaving them to wonder whether it was an accident. Three years later, Ousep receives a package that sends him searching for the answer, hounding his sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former friends, attending a cartoonistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ meeting, and even accosting a famous neurosurgeon. Meanwhile, younger son Thoma, missing his brother, falls head over heels for the much older girl who befriended them both. Haughty and beautiful, she has her own secrets. The Illicit Happiness of Other PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â€a smart, wry, and poignant novelÃ¢â‚¬â€teases you with its mystery, philosophy, and unlikely love story.\n\nSeeding between midnight &amp; noon (GMT +3) so be patient.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b08942e0e2d696c1c72a65781c8828ef7c6400","amp;dn":"Manu+Joseph+-+The+Illicit+Happiness+of+Other+People+%28ePub+Fictio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b08942e0e2d696c1c72a65781c8828ef7c6400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,176,137,66,224,226,214,150,193,199,42,101,120,28,136,40,239,124,100,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
