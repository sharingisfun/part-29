(Since there seem to be no seeders for the other Golden Circle torrent and it is only one of the two CD's anyway, I decided to post it.)\n\nThis is a rare glimpse into Coleman's mid-1960's European tour featuring David Izenzon on bass and Charles Moffett on drums. Coleman plays violin and trumpet as well as saxophone here.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\nAt the Golden Circle Stockholm documents &quot;concerts on the nights of December 3 and 4, 1965, in the Gyllene Cirkeln club in Stockholm. It marked the beginning of Coleman's contract with Blue Note.\n\nThe music has been described as 'brilliant, optimistic closely unified thematic improvisations'. \n\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz listed both volumes as part of its &quot;Core Collection&quot; and gave each a four-star rating (of a possible four stars).\n\nThe 2002 CD reissue includes previously unreleased bonus tracks in both volumes.&quot;\n\n-------\n\nTrack Listing: \n\nVolume 1\n\n    &quot;Faces and Places&quot;\n    &quot;European Echoes&quot;\n    &quot;Dee Dee&quot;\n    &quot;Dawn&quot;\n    &quot;Faces and Places&quot; (Alternate take) (*)\n    &quot;European Echoes&quot; (Alternate take) (*)\n    &quot;Doughnuts&quot; (*)\n\n\nVolume 2\n\n    &quot;Snowflakes and Sunshine&quot;\n    &quot;Morning Song&quot;\n    &quot;The Riddle&quot;\n    &quot;Antiques&quot;\n    &quot;Morning Song&quot; (Alternate take) (*)\n    &quot;The Riddle&quot; (Alternate take) (*)\n    &quot;Antiques&quot; (Alternate take) (*)\n\n(*) Previously unreleased bonus tracks included in the 2002 CD reissue.\n\n\n----\nNote that the track &quot;Doughnuts&quot; here is actually a different song than the &quot;Doughnut&quot; on the 1962 Town Hall album (which I will also post).\n\n\nPlease seed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa81d9618a573dedb93eca6e4a35b08cda531b9","amp;dn":"Ornette+Coleman+Trio-+Live+At+The+Golden+Circle+Volumes+1+and+2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aa81d9618a573dedb93eca6e4a35b08cda531b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,168,29,150,24,165,115,222,219,147,236,166,228,163,91,8,205,165,49,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
