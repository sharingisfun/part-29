This is all we filmed, partly because of security, and partly because we were enjoying ourselves. The footage came out pretty well. Some songs have some obstructions, but for the most part this is nice and clear.  \n\n\nNotes from me:\n\nThis footage has not circulated. It was supposed to be used in a multi-cam dvd but as far I know that never happened. The audio is from the camera. If you're going to upgrade the audio or use the footage for a multi-cam, please respect the credit and it would be great if you got in touch first. Thanks! \n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ce5183b8c77a6769d38976ffc8c7361da7addc2","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+Soldiers+and+Sailors+Hall+-+Pittsburgh%2C+PA+Nov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ce5183b8c77a6769d38976ffc8c7361da7addc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,229,24,59,140,119,166,118,157,56,151,111,252,140,115,97,218,122,221,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
