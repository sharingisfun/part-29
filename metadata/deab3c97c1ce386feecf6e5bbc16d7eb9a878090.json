It was produced by ITC Entertainment and ran for 24 episodes.\n\nThe series starred Ian Ogilvy as Simon Templar, an independently wealthy, somewhat mysterious &quot;do-gooder&quot; known as &quot;The Saint&quot; who was created in 1928 by Leslie Charteris and featured in a long-running series of novels and novellas. The series itself is a revival of The Saint, a long-running 1960s series that starred Roger Moore as Templar. One major difference between the two series is that the original was mostly filmed in British studios and locations, while many episodes of Return were filmed on location throughout Europe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deab3c97c1ce386feecf6e5bbc16d7eb9a878090","amp;dn":"Return+of+the+Saint+S1+%5Bh33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deab3c97c1ce386feecf6e5bbc16d7eb9a878090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,171,60,151,193,206,56,111,238,207,110,91,188,22,215,235,154,135,128,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
