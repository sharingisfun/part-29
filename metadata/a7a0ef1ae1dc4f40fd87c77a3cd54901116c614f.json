ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not so much that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an honour dished out so often as to render it close to meaningless, nor that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s such a vague statement that it could mean any number of things (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s routinely applied to both any promising Irish band and any promising stadium rock act) but rather it annoys me that it carries an connotation that thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually a good thing. You might as well tip the band to be the next Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich.\nIn Ireland, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even more common than elsewhere because, as a nation, the pressure of living up to such a major name has so far yielded only one act with comparable success- the, err, Saw Doctors- so all and any breakout bands are immediately dubbed Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe next U2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ in the uneasy hope that they respond well to the massive weight of a nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expectation.\nProbably the first band to receive the so-called Ã¢â‚¬ËœKiss of Adam ClaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ were Dublin band Aslan, who in the spring of 1986 had a major hit with their self-produced demo single Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis IsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which eventually became the longest ever play-listed single in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history. Signing to EMI, the band recorded their debut release Feel No Shame in 1988. Then, on the morning Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis IsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was due to be released in the US, in the midst of a successful North American tour, the band fired frontman Christy Dignam. And the bubble burst. They reformed five years later, but by then their style of rock was long out of fashion, though their evolving sound has helped them consistently top the Irish charts in the meantime.\nThe Platinum Collection is a three-disc retrospective, released in late 2005 to mark twenty-five years since the group began in earnest: Disc One is a collection of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singles to date, Disc Two a compilation of the best b-sides from those singles and Disc Three collects thirteen rare tracks, ranging from early radio sessions in 1980 to recently recorded cover tunes.\nThe singles encompass the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four album releases to date, as well as the two most recent non-album singles (Ã¢â‚¬ËœShine a LightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœFall on MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) and as such provide a good indication of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changing styles and fortunes; the early singles, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis IsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœPlease DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t StopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the pick of the bunch, are very much singles of their time with strong references to post-punk acts from the Smiths to Talking Heads, but with strong radio-friendly choruses that seem destined for the arena setting. After Dignam cleaned himself up, he returned to the fold with a more introspective and spiritual approach, culminating in singles like Ã¢â‚¬ËœRainmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (If I should lose my faith in God) and the smash radio hit Ã¢â‚¬ËœCrazy WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (which borrows much from Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis IsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but is here contained in its inferior re-recorded format, losing the rock-based vitality of the original single).\nChristy DignamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are at once harsh and refined; he makes no effort to disguise his own strong, high-pitched accent, yet his classical training affords him a unique, semi-conversational style that recalls at times post-war crooners like Dean Martin and Elvis Presley (likely indirectly) as much as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s informed by (his idol) David BowieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own half-talking approach. After the group reformed, Dignam took over backing vocal duties, replacing the group vocal choruses with delicate harmonies and counterpoints that bring to mind Gilmour-era Pink Floyd and, though the singer consistently denies it (everybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heard a Beatles song, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather listen to the Rolling Stones any day Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove Is All You NeedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) a strong Beatles influence has crept in in recent years, particularly on the infectious single Ã¢â‚¬ËœSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, featuring a replica the unmistakeable Lennon/McCartney group chant with Sinead OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor.\nInstrumentally, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long periods of studio inactivity (the self-imposed exile before Ã¢â‚¬ËœWaiting For This Madness To EndÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in 2001 came close to equalling their five-year break-up) have allowed for just as striking a development. The Marr- and Bowie-influenced sound of Ã¢â‚¬ËœFeel No ShameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gave way after the reunion to a sound that took in Britpop (Joe JewellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leads on Here Comes Lucy Jones are strikingly similar in tone and source to those Noel Gallagher produced on the following yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Be Here Now- probably due to a shared Gilmour/Harrison influence) and even the Replacements (Lucy Jones Part 2).\nThe b-sides and rarities discs are almost as interesting, though for completely different reasons. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unfortunate that the group never saw fit to release their authoritative cover of Pink FloydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœWish You Were HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collective favourite song) from the Made in Dublin album, but the rich assortment of cover versions here contained affirms (as if listening to Disc One wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough) oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notions that Aslan check all the right names: BowieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœRock Ã¢â‚¬ËœNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll SuicideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ5 YearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ were both released as b-sides, as well as Lou ReedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœCaroline SaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, The Rolling StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœAngieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (again, authoritative) and John LennonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœWorking Class HeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with only the latter track bordering upon Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrun of the millÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the rest are thoroughly personalised.\nRecently covered versions of Stevie WonderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœLiving for the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Tom Waits Ã¢â‚¬ËœChristmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis, are the most surprising cuts on the collection, and while the latter suffers the perennial ailment of most Waits covers, that it sounds too thin and polished in relation to the original, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLiving for the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ re-invents the classic tune and places it in a Ã¢â‚¬ËœGimmie ShelterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-era Stones mould, making it arguable the strongest non-single in the collection. The remainder of the set is a mixture of inadvisable remixes (Crazy World (Remix Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ9 sounds particularly forced), decent (Run Like the Devil) to essential (Broken Soul) originals and a rather interesting trio of 2FM sessions under the Meelah XVIII moniker in 1980, featuring three of AslanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five eventual members.\nThose looking simply for an Aslan hits collection would do better to pick up Shame About Lucy Moonhead, The Best of Aslan, which features all of the singles up to Here Comes Lucy Jones as well as the best non-single tracks, including the beautiful rock ballad Ã¢â‚¬ËœChainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, however despite the haphazard nature of The Platinum Collection (and the price, of course), itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an overall more satisfying package, even if the a-sides collection is bound to receive ninety per-cent of the plays.\nReview by Dr Dave De Sylvia (STAFF) http://www.sputnikmusic.com June 13th, 2006 .\n\n \n\nCD01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A-Sides Track Listings\n\n[01] Please Don't Stop\n[02] Loving Me Lately\n[03] This Is\n[04] Pretty Thing\n[05] Crazy World\n[06] Where's The Sun\n[07] Rainman\n[08] Hurt Sometimes\n[09] Lucy Jones (Part 1)\n[10] Lucy Jones (Part 2)\n[11] Different Man\n[12] She's So Beautiful\n[13] Six Days To Zero\n[14] Love Is All You Need\n[15] Shine A Light\n[16]  Fall On Me\n[color=red] Play Time - 01h:05m:23s\n\nCD02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ B-Sides Track Listings\n\n[01] Can't Hold Back\n[02] The Gallery\n[03] Run Like A Devil\n[04] Somethings Wrong\n[05] Dangerous Games\n[06] All I Wanted To Say (Live)\n[07] 5 Years\n[08] Caroline Says (Part 2)\n[09] Rock'n'Roll Suicide\n[10] Shine A Light (Remix)\n[11] Not The Only One\n[12] Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me)\n[13] Crazy World (Remix '9\n[14] Working Class Hero\n[15] Angie\n[16]  Dreaming Of Dreams (Remix)\n\nPlay Time - 01h:11m:14s\n\nDisc 03 - Rarities Track Listings\n\n[01] Living For The City\n[02] Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis\n[03] Jesus Says\n[04] Dont Make Me Cry\n[05] Stay\n[06] Let Loose In Heaven\n[07] Broken Soul\n[08] Dont Look Down On Me\n[09] Wont Let You Down\n[10] Toy Soldier\n[11] Movies Not Bad Dreams\n[12] Holidays On Cloudtime\n[13] Meelah Part 2\n[color=red] Play Time - 00h:55m:20s\n[/color]\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 03h:11m:57s\nTotal File Size....................... 1.30GBs (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
