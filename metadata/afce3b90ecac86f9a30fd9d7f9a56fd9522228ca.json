If you think you know the difference, then answer this question: Is the US a democracy? For the answer (surprisingly), watch this.\n\nBONUS BOOK - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good to be King: The Foundation of Our Constitutional FreedomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n...is a must read for anyone who cares about the affairs of government. In chapterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one through eight, 2004 libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik gives his unique introduction to the Constitution and presents a compelling argument of why, in America, you are a king. The next nine chapters Michael breaks down the Constitution with a sheer brilliance that comes with over 25 years of studying the document and the history of these united States. You will learn what this great document does and does not mean. In the remainder of the book Michael exposes corruption and treason within the united States and instead of leaving you with a grim tale of doom and gloom Michael also spells out a non-violent plan of hope that begins with you!\n\nThis book provides in depth analysis of the supreme law of the land with legal definitions provided by BlackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Law Dictionary throughout. Each chapter is short and to the point; Michael does not ramble or beat around the bush. This book is written to Ã¢â‚¬Å“edify and entertain school children and seasoned libertarians alike,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Congressman Ron Paul put it. And instead of telling you to take his word for it, Michael encourages you to turn over every leaf and question all authority including his own. If you would like to experience what our founders entrusted congress to preserve for you, read this book. If you could care less and would rather watch TV than donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t read it and watch your liberties go down the toilet.\n\n\nMichael Badnarik is a Constitutional scholar, and\nthe author of Good to be King, a beginner's guide\nto the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\nMichael travels across the country teaching his\nhighly acclaimed class on the Constitution to\ngrowing numbers of people suddenly interested in\n&quot;life, liberty, and property&quot;. He is also available\nto speak to community groups on a variety of\nsubjects related to private property and individual\nrights.\n\nMichael was the 2004 Libertarian nominee for\nPresident of the United States, 2006 Libertarian\ncongressional candidate in Texas, and was\nelected President of Continental Congress 2009,\nwhich met in St. Charles, Illinois to document\ngovernment violations of the Constitution.\n(see www.ArticlesOfFreedom.us)\n\nMichael has been studying the Constitution, the founding fathers, and the history of the\nAmerican Revolution for 29 years.
