Currently, no book other than this one covers this broad range of topics within motor rehabilitation technology. With a focus on cutting edge technology, it describes state-of-the-art methods within this field, from brain-computer interfaces to spinal and cortical plasticity. Touching on electrode design, signal processing, the neurophysiology of movement, robotics, and much more, this innovative volume collects the latest information for a wide range of readers working in biomedical engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34c3a2af089b71508e75016ea9fd1d7152e9e622","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Neural+Engineering+for+Motor+Rehabilitation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34c3a2af089b71508e75016ea9fd1d7152e9e622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,195,162,175,8,155,113,80,142,117,1,110,169,253,29,113,82,233,230,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
