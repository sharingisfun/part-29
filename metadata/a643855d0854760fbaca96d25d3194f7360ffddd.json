After Julia dies in front of J's eyes from a self-inflicted heroin overdose, J, who is slightly detached from life, feels he has no choice but to contact his maternal grandmother, Janine &quot;Smurf&quot; Cody, the family matriarch, for a place to live. Smurf rules the family with a borderline incestuous love over her three sons, the quietly menacing Andrew &quot;Pope&quot; Cody, the hyperactive Craig Cody, and the barely of age Darren Cody. Pope and his best friend, Barry &quot;Baz&quot; Brown, are armed robbers, with Darren their up and coming apprentice, while Craig is a mid level drug dealer. Melbourne's Armed Robbery Squad is after specifically Pope, who is hiding out. But when the standoff between the Codys and the Armed Robbery Squad is brought up a notch, an all out war ensues, with some casualties and J caught in the middle. The only grounding in J's life is his girlfriend, Nicky Henry. With those casualties comes an investigation by Homicide Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie, who knows the Codys are involved in some of those deaths. As Leckie tries to get J on his side, J has to figure out how best to get himself out from the middle, where he trusts neither side. J also wants to figure out how to exact what he considers justice in an all around bad situation.\n\n\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 48mn\nBit rate : 1 174 Kbps\nWidth : 624 pixels\nHeight : 354 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.213\nStream size : 910 MiB (83%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 48mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nVideo delay : 10ms\nStream size : 174 MiB (16%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\ninterleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nRELEASE NOTES:: Right...where do i start. At 38:36 there is a clip which is played again\n\nfor about half a second and then again 1:20:31 for a split second. This does not\n\nruin the film at all and i have warned you.\n\nYou may also notice that on imdb it says the runtime is 113mins where as this\nrelease is 108mins, i believe this is due to the fact of the fps as i have\nwatched the whole release and it seems to be all there to me.\nAnother note, as i had just just finished uploading, the AR seems a little off\nmaybe, not by much though and still very watchable(I may do a v2).\nI recieved this as 3 files(avi split up) and as you can tell it's not great, but\nthe best i could do with what i was given.\nThere was a watermark in the top right\nhand corner belonging to madman(if anything, it shows its legit and the full\nthing), and the top bit of it was cropped with black bars and the rest blurred.\nAlso as you may know, this has been sent off as an oscar screener already, but my\nfriend has had this before they were sent off... so this is not an oscar screener\nif anyone was doubting the watermark....\nI'd surgest playing this in vlc as it seemed a lil laggy on mpc(may just be me\nthough),\n\nsample included, watch before you comment...\n\nENJOY this fantastic film","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a643855d0854760fbaca96d25d3194f7360ffddd","amp;dn":"Animal+Kingdom+DVDSCR+2010+READNFO+AC3+Xvid-T0XiC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a643855d0854760fbaca96d25d3194f7360ffddd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,67,133,93,8,84,118,15,186,202,150,210,93,49,148,247,54,15,253,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
