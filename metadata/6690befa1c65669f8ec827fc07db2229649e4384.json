He spoke several languages, including Greek and Latin and was an avid reader of historical literature. He possessed a personal library of over 40 000 books as well as an extensive collection of autographs. His many socio-cultural studies in sexology earned him an international reputation as a medical historian. (He also discovered de SadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s manuscript of the &quot;120 days of Sodom&quot;, which had been believed to be lost.) In 1907, Bloch proposed the new concept of a science of sexuality: Sexualwissenschaft or sexology. With his colleague Magnus Hirschfeld  and others, he contributed to organizing this science, co-editing a Journal for Sexology and editing a &quot;Comprehensive Handbook of Sexology in a Series of Monographs&quot; (because of WWI and BlochÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early death, only a few volumes appeared). He himself wrote the first volume on &quot;Prostitution&quot;. He died rather unexpectedly at the age of 50.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6690befa1c65669f8ec827fc07db2229649e4384","amp;dn":"Marquis+de+Sade%3A+his+life+and+work+%281899%29+Iwan+Bloch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6690befa1c65669f8ec827fc07db2229649e4384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,144,190,250,28,101,102,159,142,200,39,252,7,219,34,41,100,158,67,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
