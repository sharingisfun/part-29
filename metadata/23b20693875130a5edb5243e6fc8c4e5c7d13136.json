People were probably no more or less stressed out about social and world events then as we are today.  It's how we deal with things that matters.  Pop this in the player and transport decades in the past.

Many \nare CD's from the 80's which are important to archive because those old CD's \nare at the end of their lifecycles.\n\nThis download includes a volume that has been ripped at MP3 V0 \nwhich is nearly indistinguishable from FLAC using spectral analysis. It provides \nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size. If you love \nFLAC then you'll know MP3 V0 is your other buddy for going mobile when \nspace and quality are a concern\n\nThe AccurateRip data is embedded in the MP3 tags so you can look at any \ntrack to validate the accuracy of the rip.\n\n- Big Papi\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b20693875130a5edb5243e6fc8c4e5c7d13136","amp;dn":"Eddy+Howard+%26amp%3B+His+Orchestra+-+The+22+Golden+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23b20693875130a5edb5243e6fc8c4e5c7d13136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,178,6,147,135,81,48,165,237,181,36,62,111,200,196,229,199,209,49,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
