Dean, guitarist Jay Crawford, and drummer Tony Fag (Anthony Paul Short, A.K.A. Blind Tony Fag). Their first show was July 4, 1986, opening for Flipper. Bomb&amp;#039;s sound was deep, hard rock with melodic guitars, relentless tribal drumming (reviews referred to Fag as &quot;The Human Drum Machine&quot;), strong pop singing, and sometimes-cryptic lyrics. Common subjects of the songs were death, sex, drugs, girls, boys, love, loss, Satan, God, cross-dressing, girls, suicide, hope and girls.&quot; \n\n[1987] To Elvis In Hell\n[1988] Hits Of Acid\n[1989] Happy All The Time [EP]\n[1992] Hate Fed Love\n[1999] Lovesucker [EP]\n\nquality: 128-192 kbps mp3\n\nVisit http://www.hitsofacid.com/ (artists&amp;#039; homepage) for Bomb demos and other freely download-able projects by lead singer Michael W.
