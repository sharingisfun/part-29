When 14-year-old Walter (Haley Joel Osment, teetering on puberty) spends an eventful summer with his great-uncles on their vast Texas farmland (he's been dumped there by his delinquent mom, played by Kyra Sedgwick), he soon discovers they've lived lives full of adventure, excitement, passion, and mystery. Either that or they're old-time bank robbers with a long criminal record. The truth isn't revealed until the very end. Full of enriching lessons and homespun humor, Secondhand Lions is a decent family film that anyone can enjoy.\n\n  Starring: Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Haley Joel Osment, Kyra Sedgwick, Nicky Katt.\n\n  Directed by: Tim McCanlies.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 49min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3a2eae20a5ce8bcf7cd480d41aae152a653f33","amp;dn":"Secondhand+Lions+%282003%29+%28Michael+Caine%2C+Robert+Duvall%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3a2eae20a5ce8bcf7cd480d41aae152a653f33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,58,46,174,32,165,206,139,207,124,212,128,212,26,174,21,42,101,63,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
