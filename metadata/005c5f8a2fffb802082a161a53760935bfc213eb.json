The film starred Peter Weller as good scientist/Renaissance Man Buckeroo Banzai, who led his merry band of eclectic sidekicks called &quot;The Hong Kong Cavaliers&quot; in a movie adventure to save the world from the alien reptile race the Red Lectroids.  The movie featured several well-known 1980's-era actors including John Lithgow, Jeff Goldblum and Ellen Barkin.\n\nThe man, the marvel, the human achievement, is back!
