If you downloaded this book for free, all\nI ask is that you give an honest review at either Amazon.com or at Barnes&amp;Noble.com\n\n\nAbout the title:\n&quot;Secrets have been formed in the dark corners of the kingdom. Change is in the air and whispers of new ideas and technologies have swept the land. Unfortunately, the King is old and simple and his daughter is concerned only with worldly possessions. A man by the name of Buul, a man long forgotten, has returned to pay a visit to the King on the King's birthday. He has not come empty handed and will be the King's undoing.\n\nThe King, in moments of panic and war, can trust no one with the protection of his daughter. He quickly decides to entrust her life with a creature most vile and uncommon and chains her to a Vork. He does not leave her empty handed though. His last gift to the Princess is an amulet with powers even he does not comprehend. The land's only chance, the only one loyal to the King's memory, is the daughter that cares nothing of the Kingdom of Vosh&quot;\n\n310 pages, Published by: Dark Oak Press, 2013\nAuthor/Artist:  Jason C.
