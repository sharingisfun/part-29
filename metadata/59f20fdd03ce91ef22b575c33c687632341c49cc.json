Needing fast cash for his new responsibilities, he smuggles a kilo of hash from Nepal inside pellets he actually swallows - which proves to be an easy act for this magician to perfect. He's saved more than $80,000 through his scheme and decides to make another (doomed) trip to Nepal. A bad bout of diahhrea means problems swallowing the pellets. He breaks the golden rule to never body-pack hash, and enhanced airport security for the soccer World Cup in Tokyo during a stop home gets him busted.\n\nFormat            : Matroska at 4 436 Kbps\nLength            : 1.54 GiB for 49mn 48s 600ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 3 964 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.778) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59f20fdd03ce91ef22b575c33c687632341c49cc","amp;dn":"Locked.Up.Abroad.S06E02.Juggler.Smuggler.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59f20fdd03ce91ef22b575c33c687632341c49cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,242,15,221,3,206,145,239,34,181,117,195,60,104,118,50,52,28,73,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
