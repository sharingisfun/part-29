Robb - Eve Dallas 28 - Innocent in Death-viny\n\nThe phenomenal series set in a future New York City returns as NYPSD Lt. Eve Dallas hunts for the killer of a seemingly ordinary history teacher-and uncovers some extraordinary surprises. Craig Foster's death devastated his young wife, who'd sent him to work that day with a lovingly packed lunch. It shocked his colleagues at the private school, too, and as for the ten-year-old girls who found him in his classroom in a pool of bodily fluids-they may have been traumatized for life.\n\nEve soon determines that Foster's homemade lunch was tainted with deadly ricin, and that Mr. Foster's colleagues have some startling secrets of their own. It's Eve's job to sort it out- and discover why someone would have done this to a man who seemed so inoffensive, so pleasant . . . so innocent.\n\nNow Magdalena Percell . . . there's someone Eve can picture as a murder victim. Possibly at Eve's own hands. The slinky blonde-an old flame of her billionaire husband, Roarke-has arrived in New York, and she's anything but innocent. Roarke seems blind to Magdalena's manipulation, and he insists that the occasional lunch or business meeting with her is nothing to worry about . . . and none of Eve's business. Eve's so unnerved by the situation that she finds it hard to focus on her case. Still, she'll have to put aside her feelings, for a while at least-because another man has just turned up dead.\n\nEve knows all too well that innocence can be a faÃƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ade. Keeping that in mind may help her solve this case at last. But it may also tear apart her marriage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b416b2329b26a0ea1f5a02e01c98afa99b9687f","amp;dn":"J.D.+Robb+-+Eve+Dallas+28+-+Innocent+in+Death-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b416b2329b26a0ea1f5a02e01c98afa99b9687f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,65,107,35,41,178,106,14,161,245,160,46,1,201,138,250,153,185,104,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
