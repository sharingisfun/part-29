Rachel Boynton&amp;#039;s excellent, probing documentary goes behind-the-scenes to show the manipulation and orchestration that is involved in big-time political campaigning. OUR BRAND IS CRISIS follows members of the consulting firm of Greenberg Carville Shrum to Bolivia, where they have been hired to help controversial candidate Gonzalo &quot;Goni Sanchez de Lozada reclaim the presidency. With only a few weeks left before the election, consultants Jeremy Rosner, Stan Greenberg, and James Carville work their magic, softening Goni&amp;#039;s liberal image and shaping his message to appeal to the masses. In his typically audacious fashion, Carville delivers some of the film&amp;#039;s most unforgettable quips. Meanwhile, the unemployment situation is threatening to spark a full-fledged national riot, raising the stakes even higher. Boynton&amp;#039;s film is edited at a brisk, taut pace, adding drama to the already tense proceedings. An insightful after-the-fact interview with Rosner provides even greater context for the horrific situation that unfolded a year later and which, in fact, opens the film with a bang. Enlightening, engaging, and thought provoking, OUR BRAND IS CRISIS is a vital, profound work of nonfiction cinema.\n\nScreenshots\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1606 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: Mixed English &amp; Spanish\nRunTime Per Part: 86 mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1120MB\nSubtitles: English(embedded)/Portuguese\nRipped by: Dentje\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Further Information \n* Official Site\n* Interview with the writer/director, Rachel Boynton\n\n2) Related Documentaries \n* Looking for the Revolution\n* Campaign the Kawasaki Candidate\n* Please Vote for Me\n* The War on Democracy\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Our_Brand_is_Crisis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9532fb7be37c144ff5684c43cc64ab8f55a9a1a2","amp;dn":"Our.Brand.Is.Crisis.XviD.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9532fb7be37c144ff5684c43cc64ab8f55a9a1a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,50,251,123,227,124,20,79,245,104,76,67,204,100,171,143,85,169,161,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
