The album set out to buck the trend of the popular music of the time, and served as a backlash to Ã¢â‚¬ËœGrungeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and all of its offspring. Conceived as an album from the start, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IrradiateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ runs the gambit of human emotions through diverse storytelling and song arrangement. The themes touched on by this rare recording include: isolation, betrayal, moral corruption, and the age old struggle between God and technology.\n\nTrack List\n01 - swellhead\n02 - black fruit\n03 - crawl space\n04 - judas\n05 - hateful\n06 - monster\n07 - childlike\n08 - scandal pup\n09 - can you hear me\n10 - jean\n11 - resuscitation\n\nNOTE: The band is no longer together and have not been together for over a decade. No monies from the sale of this CD will go to the artist. It all goes to the recording industry. This torrent is not stealing from an Artist. It is not taking money from sales of a CD that go to the artist.
