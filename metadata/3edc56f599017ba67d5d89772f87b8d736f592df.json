In total, 74 models were built at BRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Swindon Works and Crewe Works, and the twin Maybach engines delivered a top speed of 90mph (140 km/h). \n\nWhilst the design of the Class was largely successful, its working life was relatively short, with retirement beginning in the early 1970s and the Class being fully withdrawn by 1977 and scrapped shortly after. They were also never renumbered under TOPS, becoming the last class of locomotive on the BR network not to carry a TOPS number. \nHowever, their popularity has seen some locomotives preserved on heritage railways, with D1015 Ã¢â‚¬ËœWestern ChampionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ retaining its certificate for mainline use Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the only Ã¢â‚¬ËœWesternÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to do so. \n\nThe Class 52 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ officially licensed by the Diesel Traction Group Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for Train Simulator is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to TS2014 standard, including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling. The locomotive recreates Ã¢â‚¬ËœWestern ChampionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as seen today operating rail tours, and is available in BR Western Region Ã¢â‚¬ËœRedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ livery including BR Ã¢â‚¬Ëœchocolate and creamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Mk1 coaching stock. \n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR Class 52 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for The Riviera Line: Exeter-Paignton route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\n\nFour scenarios for The Riviera Line: Exeter-Paignton route: \n\n\nTraining: Class 52 Simple Controls \n\nTraining: Class 52 Expert Controls \n\nChocolate and Cream \n\nTricky Time to Exeter\n\nClass 52 in BR Western Ã¢â‚¬ËœRedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ livery \n\nBR Ã¢â‚¬Ëœchocolate and creamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Mk1 coaches \n\nQuick Drive compatible \n\nScenarios for The Riviera Line: Exeter-Paignton route ONLY\n\nENJOY AND SEED PEOPLE!!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3edc56f599017ba67d5d89772f87b8d736f592df","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+BR+Class+52+Loco+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3edc56f599017ba67d5d89772f87b8d736f592df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,220,86,245,153,1,123,166,125,93,137,119,47,135,184,215,54,245,146,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
