It was designed by Matt Callen (brother of Brad Callen of SEO Elite and Keyword Elite fame).\n\nThis case study shows how Abhishek Agarwal made Google AdSense money (hosting Google Ads on the new website).  He also reinvested some of those earnings into Googles AdWords (Advertising the site on Google), which increased traffic to his site.\n\nAnyway, this is my first torrent that I am uploading.\n\nCan anyone let me know if I posted it right.\n\nI don't want to get in trouble for uploading this.\n\nThanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5ff974acbe3d5a52fb7f88cb40ed7eb58d30eb","amp;dn":"HyperVRE+Case+Study+-+Version+2.0.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5ff974acbe3d5a52fb7f88cb40ed7eb58d30eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,95,249,116,172,190,61,90,82,251,127,136,203,64,237,126,181,141,48,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
