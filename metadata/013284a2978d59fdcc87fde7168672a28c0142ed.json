The text of the Bible, the Word of God itself, Luther argued, revealed the only true path to salvationÃ¢â‚¬â€not priestly ritual and saintly iconography.\n\nBut if wordsÃ¢â‚¬â€not iconic imagesÃ¢â‚¬â€showed the way to salvation, why didn't religious imagery during the Reformation disappear along with indulgences? The answer, according to Joseph Leo Koerner, lies in the paradoxical nature of Protestant religious imagery itself, which is at once both iconic and iconoclastic. Koerner masterfully demonstrates this point not only with a multitude of Lutheran images, many never before published, but also with a close reading of a single pivotal workÃ¢â‚¬â€Lucas Cranach the Elder's altarpiece for the City Church in Wittenberg (Luther's parish). As Koerner shows, Cranach, breaking all the conventions of traditional Catholic iconography, created an entirely new aesthetic for the new Protestant ethos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013284a2978d59fdcc87fde7168672a28c0142ed","amp;dn":"The+Reformation+of+the+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013284a2978d59fdcc87fde7168672a28c0142ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,50,132,162,151,141,89,253,204,135,253,231,22,134,114,162,140,1,66,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
