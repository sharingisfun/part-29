Missing out on the latest driver releases means your PC and hardware devices are being cheated from bug fixes, performance improvements, and potential new features from the manufacturer. Driver Reviver saves you time. It will require numerous hours to track down each and every driver for every single piece of hardware connected to your PC. Driver Reviver accomplishes this in minutes. Driver Reviver saves you money. There are driver sites that provide drivers on a cost-per-download basis. Your system will likely require hundreds of updates in its lifetime, so this option is expensive. In contrast, the number of drivers you can download using Driver Reviver is limitless during the subscription period. Driver Reviver prevents you from incorrectly using the wrong driver. Drivers are hardware-dependent and operating system-specific. This means that drivers (1) must be compatible to your PC's operating system, and (2) be suited to your hardware's brand and model. Driver Reviver automatically works on this basis so you're assured that driver update recommendations are specific to your system and hardware. No need to be tech-savvy. It takes a bit of PC knowledge to scan for drivers, download them, and install them properly. Driver Reviver does all this for you. Driver Reviver finds the right driver straight from the manufacturer directly. There is no need to hunt for the original installation CD or wasting time crawling the web. Driver Reviver completely reduces your risk of downloading a faulty driver or even spyware. The wrong driver or malware could render your PC inoperable and potentially put you at risk of identity theft. Driver Reviver protects you from mistakes. Restore point setting ensures that if there are any problems with an update, the changes can be easily reversed to get you back up and running in no time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e783fa801e226c0c0b13796f2c0cbf349d90db5","amp;dn":"Driver.Reviver.5.0.0.76","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e783fa801e226c0c0b13796f2c0cbf349d90db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,120,63,168,1,226,38,192,192,177,55,150,242,192,203,243,73,217,13,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
