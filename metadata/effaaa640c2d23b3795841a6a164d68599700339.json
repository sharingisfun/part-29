Here, Marvel\nhas taken the original art of old romance stories it owns, including Patsy Walker stories, and written new words in the existing word balloons and narration blocks. It canÃƒÂ¢??t be too easy a task, telling a whole story and making it funny within the given structure, but this actually works ÃƒÂ¢?? mostly by the sheer silliness of making fun of the art in a panel and of the mod fashions of the time, allusions to sex, and sending up the whole romance style, but youÃƒÂ¢??ll find a variety of other laughs as well. Each issue contains around five or six stories that are just short enough so that the running gags donÃƒÂ¢??t get tiring.\n\n(from ComicCritique.com)\n\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:effaaa640c2d23b3795841a6a164d68599700339","amp;dn":"Marvel+Romance+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"effaaa640c2d23b3795841a6a164d68599700339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,250,170,100,12,45,35,179,121,88,65,166,161,100,214,133,153,112,3,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
