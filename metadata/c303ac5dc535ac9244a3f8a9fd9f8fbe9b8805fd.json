It's sharp and it's brilliantly illustrated...&quot; - Multiversity Comics\n\n&quot;A crime/horror series with a highly polished style... and a healthy dash of noir&quot; - From Earth's End\n\nThe Nationalist Army of China comes to Moth City to purchase a mysterious new weapon, hidden communist forces take violent action and an Industrialist's daughter fights for her freedom in Season 1 of Moth City.\n\n'Moth City' is a fresh take on the murder mystery that lives at the intersection of detective fiction, noir-horror and 1970s Kung Fu movies. It is a story about control - when we lose it, when we gain it, and when others hold it over us.\n\n381 pages\nPublisher: Flying Whities / Thrillbent\n\nTim Gibson spent his formative years working in Animation and Design at WETA, before packing his Wacom pen and convincing a New Zealand government arts funder (Creative New Zealand) to help him launch Moth City. He combines 3D sculpting, animation and graphic design in an attempt to hide his badly drawn feet. He lives on a windswept hill in Wellington with neither pets nor children and is is active on both Twitter and Facebook.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c303ac5dc535ac9244a3f8a9fd9f8fbe9b8805fd","amp;dn":"MOTH+CITY+-+SEASON+1+%282013%29+%28Thrillbent%29+%28digital+trade+with+bon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c303ac5dc535ac9244a3f8a9fd9f8fbe9b8805fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,3,172,93,197,53,172,146,68,163,248,169,253,159,143,190,155,136,5,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
