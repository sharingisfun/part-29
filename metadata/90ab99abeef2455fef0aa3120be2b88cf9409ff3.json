[Bootleg]\nRecorded  Live at Aichken Taiikukan, Nagoya, Japan - March 03, 1976.\nLabel:Tarantura \nFormat:Flac\n\nThis was YoungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first visit to Japan and he played seven shows in Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Tokyo. All of the shows have been taped and many pressed. The most recent releases include Another Osaka (Screamer), which contains half of the March 4th show, and GFK (Watch Tower) containing the Fukuoka tape. Wet Show, one of two recent Neil Young releases on the Tarantura label, contains a brand new complete audience recording. An older excellent audience recording exists and was released several years ago on You Are Just A Dream (F*!#inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Up FUPCD-2001/2002), but is missing the second encore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCortez The Killer.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Wet Show legitimately has the second encore and for the first time this show is complete. The sound quality is simply stunning. It is a three dimensional stereo audience recording taped right in front of the stage. The balance between the instruments and audience is perfect, and is detailed enough to pick up YoungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s off-mic comments. This recording of the first show of 1976 Japanese Tour is from a previously uncirculated master and contains a previously uncirculated second encore of Cortez The Killer. This is a recent release from the apparently exclusive Tarantura label and is supposed to be direct from the original cassette masters. The sound is stellar\n\nDisc 1\n01. Intro\n02. Tell Me Why\n03.
