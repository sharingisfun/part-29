The record features a more blues-influenced sound than previous albums and contains the hits &quot;Wild Side&quot; and &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;. The record also reflects the band's hard-living lifestyle, and pays homage to their love of riding fast, large motorcycles, drinking whiskey, and spending long nights at strip clubs. There are darker sides to the album as well, notably Nikki Sixx's song 'Dancing on Glass', about his addiction to heroin, and 'Wild Side', which tells of destructive lifestyles and the pitfalls of decadence. The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard charts. On the week it might have reached No. 1, Whitney Houston's second album, Whitney, debuted at the top of the charts. Eventually, the group's 1989's offering Dr. Feelgood would go on to claim the top Billboard spot. Controversy surrounded Girls, Girls, Girls' third single, &quot;You're All I Need,&quot; which, although a ballad, featured lyrics that detail a lover's grisly murder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a80cee249f08be2349ab725de38851d0939b3716","amp;dn":"M%26ouml%3Btley+Cr%26uuml%3Be+-+Girls%2C+Girls%2C+Girls+%5B1987%5D+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a80cee249f08be2349ab725de38851d0939b3716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,12,238,36,159,8,190,35,73,171,114,93,227,136,81,208,147,155,55,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
