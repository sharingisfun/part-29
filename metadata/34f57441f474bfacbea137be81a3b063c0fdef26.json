Graphic panels draw you into the exploits of these pretenders, and meticulously researched details keep you on the edge of your seat. Each scene is presented in the second person, a unique point of view that literally places you inside the faker's mind. With motivations that include survival, delusion, and plain, old-fashioned greed, the psychology of deception has never been so fascinating or so close at hand","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34f57441f474bfacbea137be81a3b063c0fdef26","amp;dn":"Can+I+See+Your+ID+-+Chris+Barton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34f57441f474bfacbea137be81a3b063c0fdef26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,245,116,65,244,116,191,172,190,161,55,190,129,163,176,99,192,253,239,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
