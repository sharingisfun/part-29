It will extract to C:Windows Activation AIO 2010\n\nIf you wish to run the app again later, just repeat the above and choose &quot;yes to all&quot; when WinRAR prompts to overwrite files. It will\n\nstart up automatically.\n\nYou can just delete the folder if you no longer need it.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the activators:\n\n\nWindows 7 Loader v1.8.3 (DAZ):\n\n\nThis is one of the best all around activatorsloaders. Very easy to use and works 99% of the time. My first pick.\n\n\nWindows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition v3.503:\n\n\nThis one is also an excellent choice and works with many versions of Win 7, Vista and even Server 2008.\nIt is a bit more complicated, but try it if the DAZ loader fails.\n\n\nRemoveWAT 2.25:\n\n\nI have limited experience with this, but it does work and some swear by it. It removes Windows Activation, but gives you the option\nto restore.\n\n\nChew WGA 9:\n\n\nThis I have used extensively and it works with ANY version of Windows 7 100% of the time. The problem is that Micro$oft\nhas released an update (KB971033) that detects and blacklists you if you install it. As long as you avoid the update, it will work.\n\n\n\nmini-KMS Activator:\n\n\nThis works great to activate Office 2010 products. I never really tried it other than that.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6ccad5b979c14202d567667289b1e42ae55ee50","amp;dn":"Windows+Activation+AIO+2010+Activator+ALLinONE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6ccad5b979c14202d567667289b1e42ae55ee50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,204,173,91,151,156,20,32,45,86,118,103,40,155,30,66,174,85,238,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
