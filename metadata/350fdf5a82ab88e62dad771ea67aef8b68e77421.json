It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it. Nevertheless, you need to know something, so we will just say this: It is extremely funny, but the African beach scene is horrific. The story starts there, but the book doesn't. And it's what happens afterward that is most important. Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:350fdf5a82ab88e62dad771ea67aef8b68e77421","amp;dn":"Chris+Cleave+-+Little+Bee+-+Svensk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"350fdf5a82ab88e62dad771ea67aef8b68e77421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,15,223,90,130,171,136,230,45,173,119,30,166,122,239,139,104,231,116,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
