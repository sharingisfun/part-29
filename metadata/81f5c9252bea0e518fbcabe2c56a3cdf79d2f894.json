I'm not sure about Macs.\n\nI've got ebook packs for lots of other things [from artificial intelligence to LaTeX to reverse engineering, and everything in between] coming soon.\n\nFeedback, especially on the naming scheme, is much appreciated. This is the pattern I use to name ebooks on my machine, and I'm especially curious to hear what others think. While I don't think that the Amazon avg. customer rating is a foolproof indicator of a book's quality (look at SICP, for example), it's the best I've found, in addition to skimming the table of contents. And if anyone knows how to make Nautilus sort a 4.5* filename AFTER a 4* filename (aside from reversing the overall sort order, smartasses), please let me know.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f5c9252bea0e518fbcabe2c56a3cdf79d2f894","amp;dn":"Ruby%2C+Rails+ebooks+%5Bbirdwin%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f5c9252bea0e518fbcabe2c56a3cdf79d2f894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,245,201,37,43,234,14,81,143,188,171,226,197,106,60,223,121,210,248,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
