David Talbot describes a JFK administration more besieged by domestic enemies than has been previously realized, from within the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, and the mob. It is against this dark backdrop that he charts the emotionally charged journey of Robert Kennedy, whose soul-scouring quest to find the origins of his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder led him, to his horror, back to the dark corners of American power that had been part of his portfolio: U.S. intelligence, Cuba, and organized crime.\n\nFrom the Kennedy Ã¢â‚¬Å“band of brothersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to RFKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope of using executive power to solve JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death once and for all, this probing work of history draws on more than 150 exclusive interviews to produce a bold look at power and vengeance. A topic of perennial interest, Brothers is a multilayered, complex tale of gut-wrenching history.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nThose looking for new insight into John F. Kennedy's presidency will want to read this meticulously researched chronicle. Talbot, the journalist founder of online newsmagazine Salon, sticks to the facts, starting with a timeline of then-attorney general Bobby Kennedy's actions on Nov. 22, 1963, the day his brother was killed. Immediately suspicious of the CIA, the Mafia and the Cuban exiles they're involved with, Bobby made it his mission to expose this &quot;shadowy nexus&quot;; much of the book concerns the Kennedy brothers' relationships with members of those factions as they dig for the truth behind the assassination. Talbot profiles friends and enemies, taking readers into JFK's strained work with Pentagon officials who famously pressured him to take a chance on the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion. Later chapters deal with the aftermath of JFK's and then RFK's assassinations, and the final chapter contains Talbot's incisive conclusions on those momentous years. Talbot's only weakness is in covering too much-with more than 150 original interviews, he is forced to move too quickly from event to event, making his numerous characters hard to keep straight. Still, it's an admirable feat of reporting, and one that will spark conversation among conspiracy theorists, historians and others who lived through the Kennedy era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d5d98180f7c5dc3ff6e6cec9691d52485b995d","amp;dn":"David+Talbot+-+Brothers+%28Kennedy+Admin%29+2007+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d5d98180f7c5dc3ff6e6cec9691d52485b995d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,213,217,129,128,247,197,220,63,246,230,206,201,105,29,82,72,91,153,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
