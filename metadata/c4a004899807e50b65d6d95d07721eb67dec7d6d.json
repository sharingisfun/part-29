Does this sound something like your day at the office? You are driving on a rain-soaked freeway. The other cars are speeding past you. You speed up to stay in the flow, but your knuckles are white as you grip the wheel. Familiar? Here&amp;#039;s how to find the next exit.\n\nAbout the author:\nAdrian Savage is a writer, an Englishman, and a retired corporate executive?more or less in that order. He took a Master?s degree at Cambridge, worked in a range of organizations ranging from central and local government to giant multi-nationals, taught in a British business school, founded two successful consulting companies, and ended his career as CEO of a corporation based in California. He now lives in Tucson, Arizona, where he enjoys the desert and its amazing wildlife?not to mention a very different climate from the land where he was born. His second book, Slow Leadership: Civilizing the Organization, is to be published in October 2006.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4a004899807e50b65d6d95d07721eb67dec7d6d","amp;dn":"%28PDF%29+%28Manifesto%29+Slow+Leadership+Creating+Civilized+Organizatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4a004899807e50b65d6d95d07721eb67dec7d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,160,4,137,152,7,229,11,101,214,217,93,7,114,30,182,125,236,125,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
