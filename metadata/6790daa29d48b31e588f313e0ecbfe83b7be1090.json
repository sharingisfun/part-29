I just wish it was at least 256 kbps.  The speaker farts are irritating sometimes because of the 128...\n\nHey, one advantage to the 128 is that you should be able to seed it to at least 1:1 on your end.  Please???\n\nCOMMENT!\nv v v v","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6790daa29d48b31e588f313e0ecbfe83b7be1090","amp;dn":"DC-12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6790daa29d48b31e588f313e0ecbfe83b7be1090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,144,218,162,157,72,179,30,88,143,49,62,14,203,254,131,183,190,16,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
