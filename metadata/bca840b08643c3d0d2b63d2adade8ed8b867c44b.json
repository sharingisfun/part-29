This is not just an old album. It&amp;#039;s the first ever (and i meen ever) mix compilation release not just for Renaissance Uk but for the house music industry globaly. This compilation is a sparkling piece of history of what we call house music. In fact its the begining of it. \n\nBefore Renaissance re-issued the &quot;Mix Collection&quot; celebrating its 10th anniversary some college students from the us bought a copy of it from eBay for 4000$! Since most of us will never put our hands on an original 1994 retail copy i guess we&amp;#039;ll have to settle with the mp3s!!\n\nWe wanted to share something special with all our friends and visitors who keep this blog alive and kickin (and growing) but it was kind of hard task since we share everyday what we love most, and thats music. So we picked this one.\n\nI&amp;#039;m pretty sure there&amp;#039;s a great number of around 30-still grooving folks in our community that will appreciate this album and maybe some younger that would like to know how it all started and what we used to dance back then at our crazy fridays.\n\nWe wish you all the best.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bca840b08643c3d0d2b63d2adade8ed8b867c44b","amp;dn":"Sasha+and+John+Digweed+Renaissance+The+Mix+Collection+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bca840b08643c3d0d2b63d2adade8ed8b867c44b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,168,64,176,134,67,195,208,210,182,61,42,218,222,142,216,184,103,196,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
