Han (SME, 2002).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-87335-215-4\r\n\r\nWater-based techniques are widely used in minerals processing to separate valuable minerals and ore from less desirable materials. This comprehensive technical reference provides an overview of aqueous metallurgy and its applications in mineral processing operations. The text presents the physicochemical principles of various water-based processes.\r\n\r\nWritten as a text for college- and graduate-level instruction, the book presents the fundamental principles of water-based metallurgy. The author has taught these topics at the college level for more than 30 years, and this book summarizes his lecture notes and vast experience in mineral processing science. It is a valuable reference for those studying mineral processing, resource recovery, and the corrosion of metals and alloys. In addition, it's a practical reference for environmental and chemical engineers, chemists, and mineral processing engineers who are responsible for mineral processing plant design and operations.\r\n\r\nTo enhance learning and provide practical experience, each chapter closes with a series of homework problems based on the various concepts presented. Solutions to the problems, including full explanations, are provided at the back of the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:616b1002d6f7a8900a86aac654a6147c45d6fab1","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Aqueous+Metallurgy+-+Kenneth+N.+Han","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"616b1002d6f7a8900a86aac654a6147c45d6fab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,107,16,2,214,247,168,144,10,134,170,198,84,166,20,124,69,214,250,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
