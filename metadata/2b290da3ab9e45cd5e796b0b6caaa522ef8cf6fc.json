The answer is usually yes and no, for while Above &amp; Beyond are proud of their role in defining the melodic trance sound and their synonymy with the quality end of the genre, trance is too small a word for what they do.\n\nThere's no clearer example of this than the success of Anjunadeep, the trio's melodic and progressive house offshoot thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s grown from being a promising sibling label to a dynamic and influential imprint in its own right, winning fans such as James Zabiela, Desyn Masiello, Eric Prydz, and Laurent Garnier along the way, and receiving a nomination for Best Record Label at DJ MagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Best of British Awards 2008.\n\nIt's a progression which brings us to 'Above &amp; Beyond Anjunadeep:01', the label's debut compilation. Anjunadeep stalwarts Jaytech, Michael Cassette (aka Komytea), Interplay, Joonas Hahmo and recent high profile addition 16 Bit Lolitas, are joined by newer faces like Colombia's Liluca, Russia's Proff and Canadian Paul Keeley, as Above &amp; Beyond conjure up two CD's of spirited melodic house music. A special treat comes in the form of Above &amp; BeyondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own remix of Radiohead ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ReckonerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, officially licensed via XL Recordings for the physical format only.\n\nABOVE &amp; BEYONDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S JONO GRANT SAID:\n&quot;If Anjunabeats is there to serve trance DJ's, then Anjunadeep exists to release tracks that both house and trance dj's might play. The UK scene in particular can be quite obsessed with categorisations, but Above &amp; Beyond has always just been about quality uplifting dance music and this compilation illustrates the kind of stuff you'll hear in the early part of one of our longer sets.&quot;\n\n&quot;Last night I played 4 Anjunadeep tracks. I can't think of any label where I've done that...love the stuff you guys are putting out&quot; James Zabiela\n\n&quot;Anjunadeep = Bomb Squad&quot; Desyn Masiello (SOS)\n\n&quot;Like the label&quot; Eric Prydz\n\n&quot;Get up close to the speaker and you'll hear that Anjunadeep is working on a sound all of its own&quot; DJ Magazine\n\nTracklist\n\nDisc 1\n16 Bit Lolitas - Nobody Seems To Care\nInterplay - Room Service\nLiluca - Clear Senses\nKomytea - 9\nPaul Keeley - Life Aquatic\nJaytech - Sundance\nJoonas Hahmo - Warm Up\nPROFF - Deep Orange\nElectrobios &amp; Interplay - With You\nAbove &amp; Beyond Pres.
