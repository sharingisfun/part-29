The film highlights the many effects of building railroads and their enormous importance to military and warfare. It shows a journey through a sunken empire along its thousands and thousands of kilometers of railroad tracks which lead us to the cities and villages, forests and mountains, wide plain sand rocky coasts under the double headed eagle of Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fb/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bf/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/On-the-Rails-of-the-Double-Headed-Eagle-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3152 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1276 x 716\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.782 (~16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: German/English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 52mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.14 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://contentsales.orf.at/show_content.php?hid=8&amp;sid=48&amp;filter=315&amp;sub_filter=0&amp;mpi_id=398328","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88c94aa4d203cd05226be61503193cbdfcdc8280","amp;dn":"On+The+Rails+Of+The+Double+Headed+Eagle+1of2+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88c94aa4d203cd05226be61503193cbdfcdc8280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,201,74,164,210,3,205,5,34,107,230,21,3,25,60,189,252,220,130,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
