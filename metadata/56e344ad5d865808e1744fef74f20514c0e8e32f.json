Greater access, as well as greater collaboration, to this new interdisciplinary field is intended for both synthetic carbohydrate chemists and researchers in nanoscience related fields. It covers:\r\n\r\nthe main types of nanostructures presently under investigation for modification by carbohydrates, including nanoparticles, nanorods, magnetic particles, dendrimers, nanoporous, and surface confined structures\r\noverview and introduction to the field of carbohydrate nanotechnology, and especially its applications to its biological systems\r\nProvides a unique resource for researchers to learn about the techniques used to characterize the physical and biological properties of carbohydrate-modified nanostructures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e344ad5d865808e1744fef74f20514c0e8e32f","amp;dn":"Carbohydrate+Nanotechnology+-+Keith+J.+Stine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e344ad5d865808e1744fef74f20514c0e8e32f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,227,68,173,93,134,88,8,225,116,79,239,116,242,5,20,192,232,227,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
