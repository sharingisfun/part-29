It's one of the few series from that era ( the early 1960s ) to co-star a criminal whom Sheriff Garrett allows to get away with a lot of his bad behavior, while Billy manages to cover up his more serious crimes such as robbery and quite possibly even murder!\n\nAdd to that some cool music by Mexican composer Juan GarcÃƒÂ­a Esquivel ( credited only as &quot;Esquivel&quot; ), and you have yourself the making of a better than average half-hour black &amp; white TV western!\n\nIn real life Garrett shot his notorious outlaw friend, but there was no series finale filmed.
