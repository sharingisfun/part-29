But when the two federal agents assigned to the investigation are taken out, the FBI takes a more personal interest in the case.\n\nSpecial Agent Ty Grady is pulled out of undercover work after his case blows up in his face. He's cocky, abrasive, and indisputably the best at what he does. But when he's paired with Special Agent Zane Garrett, it's hate at first sight. Garrett is the perfect image of an agent: serious, sober, and focused, which makes their partnership a classic clichÃƒÂ©: total opposites, good cop-bad cop, the odd couple. They both know immediately that their partnership will pose more of an obstacle than the lack of evidence left by the murderer.\n\nPractically before their special assignment starts, the murderer strikes again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this time at them. Now on the run, trying to track down a man who has focused on killing his pursuers, Grady and Garrett will have to figure out how to work together before they become two more notches in the murderer's knife.\n\nCut &amp; Run Series Book Two - Sequel to Cut &amp; Run\n\nSix months after nearly losing their lives to a serial killer in New York City, FBI Special Agents Ty Grady and Zane Garrett are suffering through something almost as frightening: the monotony of desk duty. When they're ordered to take a vacation for the good of everyone's sanity, Ty bites the bullet and takes Zane home with him to West Virginia, hoping the peace and quiet of the mountains will give them the chance to explore the explosive attraction theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve so far been unable to reconcile with their professional partnership.\n\nTy and Zane, along with TyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father and brother, head up into the Appalachian mountains for a nice, relaxing hike deep into the woods... where no one will hear them scream. They find themselves facing danger from all directions: unpredictable weather, the unrelenting mountains, wild animals, fellow hikers with nothing to lose, and the most terrifying challenge of all. Each other.\n\nCut &amp; Run Series Book Three: Sequel to Sticks &amp; Stones\n\nSpecial Agents Ty Grady and Zane Garrett are back on the job, settled into a personal and professional relationship built on fierce protectiveness and blistering passion. Now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re assigned to impersonate two members of an international smuggling ringÃ¢â‚¬â€an out-and-proud married coupleÃ¢â‚¬â€on a Christmas cruise in the Caribbean. As their boss says, surely theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather kiss each other than be shot at, and he has no idea how right he is.\n\nPortraying the wealthy criminals requires a particular change in attitude from Ty and Zane while dealing with the frustrating waiting game that is their assignment. As it begins to affect how they treat each other in private, they realize thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to being partners than watching each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s backs, and when the case takes an unexpected turn and threatens TyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, he and Zane will have to navigate seas of white lies and stormy secrets, including some of their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81881cccdb95f143c1570ef78eebef7df11a712f","amp;dn":"Cut+%26amp%3B+Run+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81881cccdb95f143c1570ef78eebef7df11a712f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,136,28,204,219,149,241,67,193,87,14,247,142,235,239,125,241,26,113,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
