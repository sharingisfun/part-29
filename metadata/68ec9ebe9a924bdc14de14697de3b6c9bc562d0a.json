Inspired by a locally driven, nose-to-tail approach to butchery, this new wave of meat mavens is redefining the way we buy and cook our beef, pork, fowl, and game. The momentum of this revived butcher-love has created a carnivorous frenzy, pulling a new generation of home cooks straight into the kitchen--Primal Cuts: Cooking with America's Best Butchers is their modern meat bible.\r\n\r\nMarissa Guggiana, food activist, writer, and fourth generation meat purveyor traveled the country to discover 50 of our most gifted butchers and share their favorite dishes, personal stories, and cooking techniques. From the Michelin star chef to the small farmer who raises free-range animals--butchers are the guide for this unique visual cookbook, packed with tons of their most prized recipes and good old-fashioned know-how. Readers will learn how to cook conventional and unconventional meat cuts, how to talk to their local butcher, and even how to source and buy their own whole animals for their home freezer. Much more than just a cookbook, Primal Cuts is a revealing look into the lives, philosophy, and work of true food artisans, all bound by a common respect for the food they produce and an absolute love for what they do.\r\n\r\nPrimal Cuts includes:\r\n\r\n 50 Profiles and Portraits of America's Best Butchers\r\n 100 Meat Recipes for the Home Cook\r\n Practical Advice on Techniques and Tools\r\n Hundreds of Diagrams, Illustrations, and Photos\r\n Home Butchering How-To\r\n Tons of Trade Secrets\r\n\r\nRevised edition includes:\r\n\r\n updated profiles\r\n at least 5 new butchers swapped in\r\n at least 10 new recipes\r\n revised sidebars and resource guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ec9ebe9a924bdc14de14697de3b6c9bc562d0a","amp;dn":"Primal+Cuts+%28Revised+and+Updated+Ed%29+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ec9ebe9a924bdc14de14697de3b6c9bc562d0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,236,158,190,154,146,75,220,20,222,20,105,125,227,182,201,188,86,45,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
