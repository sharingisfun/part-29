If, like Alan Davies, you still think the Henry VIII had six wives, the earth has only one moon, that George Washington was the first president of the USA, that Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, that the largest living thing is a blue whale, that Alexander Graeme Bell invented the telephone, that whisky and bagpipes come from Scotland or that Mount Everest is the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tallest mountain, then there are at least 200 reasons why this is the book for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6be68110958ed07f6c557d7eebfb758e3554d9","amp;dn":"QI%3AThe+Book+of+General+Ignorance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6be68110958ed07f6c557d7eebfb758e3554d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,107,230,129,16,149,142,208,127,108,85,125,126,235,251,117,142,53,84,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
