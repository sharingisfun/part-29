SMS-it supports Picture messages, Caller Group Graphic, Operator Logo, Ringtones and Flash SMS. The messages can be sent through an attached modem, through an internet connection or directly through an attached mobile phone. If a mobile phone is attached to the computer (IE through the IR port), the contents of the inbox can be downloaded and stored in folders. The phonebook can also be downloaded and synchronized with SMS-it!. \n\nSending Picture messages, Caller Group Graphics, Operator Logos and Ringtones only work for Nokia phones. Most new phones can however now receive FlashSMS. \n\nDownloading and synchronizing the address book is possible on most mobile phones that can connect to a computer (either through the IR port or a cable link).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e515ed8f8ddbd279a5fb61a01c34727a5069fcdb","amp;dn":"SMS-it+3.65+%5BeNJ0Y-iT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e515ed8f8ddbd279a5fb61a01c34727a5069fcdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,21,237,143,141,219,210,121,165,251,97,160,28,52,114,122,80,105,252,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
