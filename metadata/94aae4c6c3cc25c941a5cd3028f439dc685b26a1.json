With the return of mankind's ancient foe and the kingdom engulfed in civil war, you have been chosen by fate to unite the shattered lands and slay the archdemon once and for all. Explore a stunning world, make complex moral choices, and engage in bone-crushing combat against massive and terrifying creatures.\r\nDetermine your legacy and fight for Thedas as a noble dwarf, an elf far from home, a mage apprentice, or a customized hero of your own design. Experience many unique origin stories on your quest to unite the kingdoms and defeat an ancient evil.\r\nAwakening Expansion Pack\r\nBecome the commander of the Grey Wardens and embark on a new campaign in the world of Amaranthine. You'll fight new enemies, learn new spells, and fend off the advancing Darkspawn forces.\r\nNine Content Packs\r\nThe Stone Prisoner, Warden's Keep, Return to Ostagar, Feastday Gifts, Lailana's Song, The Darkspawn Chronicles, The Golems of Amgarrak, Witch Hunt, and the Blood Dragon Armor.\r\nDetermine your origin: customize your hero's physical appearance and character alignment, but choose wisely.

Choices determine where you begin your journey and future interactions.\r\nBuild loyalty: recruit over a half-dozen party members, including mages, deadly assassins, a berzerker dwarf, and a warrior from the giant Qunari race. With so many different personalities, you'll have to watch your words to build trust, loyalty, and maybe even romance.\r\nMake every move count: combine your own moves with those of your teammates to build a melee attack.
