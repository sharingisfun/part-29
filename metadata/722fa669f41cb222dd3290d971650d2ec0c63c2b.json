Between the occasional bombing, sweeping of opiate farms, and not killing each other a new threat looms on the horizon. When cultures clash, and enemies seek each other out there is bound to be mistrust and anitmosity. The undead horde that is descending down upon them cares little for the politics of mortal man, just their blood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:722fa669f41cb222dd3290d971650d2ec0c63c2b","amp;dn":"Graveyard+of+Empires+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"722fa669f41cb222dd3290d971650d2ec0c63c2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,47,166,105,244,28,178,34,221,50,144,217,113,101,13,46,192,198,60,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
