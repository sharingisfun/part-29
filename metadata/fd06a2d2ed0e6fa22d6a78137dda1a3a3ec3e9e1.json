Along with 1984, it gives Van Halen two original (not a greatest hits) albums with Diamond status in sales -- a feat achieved by only four other rock bands: The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Def Leppard.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo, &quot;Eruption&quot;, was hugely influential on many guitarists. The cadenza near the end is generally regarded as seminal in the development of fretboard tapping, a virtuosic style of solo guitar playing which became popular in the 1980s. The solo's &quot;dive-bomb&quot; pitches also led to the wide-spread use of bridge tremolo bars. &quot;Eruption&quot; was added to the album when producer, Ted Templeman heard Eddie warming up with the instrumental. Eddie told Ted that it was just a solo piece he played live.\n\nThe album cover was shot at the world famous Whisky a Go Go.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide one\nRunnin' With the Devil 3:35\nEruption 1:42\nYou Really Got Me (Ray Davies) 2:37\nAin't Talkin''Bout Love 3:49\nI'm the One 3:46\n\nSide two\nJamie's Cryin' 3:30\nAtomic Punk 3:01\nFeel Your Love Tonight 3:42\nLittle Dreamer 3:22\nIce Cream Man (John Brim) 3:19\nOn Fire 3:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd06a2d2ed0e6fa22d6a78137dda1a3a3ec3e9e1","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Van+Halen+%281978%29+Japan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd06a2d2ed0e6fa22d6a78137dda1a3a3ec3e9e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,6,162,210,237,14,111,162,45,106,120,19,125,218,26,58,62,195,233,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
