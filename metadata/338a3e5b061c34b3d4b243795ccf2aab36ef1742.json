The Scientist uses his own intellect to create the B.R.A.I.N., a thinking robot. However, the dictator quickly seizes it and integrates it into the Fabrication Machine, an armature that can construct an army of war machines to destroy the dictator's enemies. Lacking a soul, the Fabrication Machine is corrupted and exterminates all organic life using toxic gas. In desperation, the Scientist uses alchemy to create nine homunculus-like rag dolls known as Stitchpunks using portions of his own soul via a talisman, but dies as a result.\n\nLanguage: ITA-ENG\nSub: ITA-ENG\nMENU': Yes\nEXTRAS: Yes\nPROGRAMMA : CloneDVD\nFILE: ISO\nSize: 6.71 Gb\n\nViewing / Installation Instructions\n\nUse VLC player to watch.\nOr you can burn to DVD with NERO or a similar program.
