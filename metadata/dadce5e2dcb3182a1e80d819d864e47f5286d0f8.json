The reaction to Caro's subsequent front-page story was explosive, as Trotter's sizable hometown moved to ban the ancient delicacy known as foie gras while an international array of activists, farmers, chefs and politicians clashed forcefully and sometimes violently over whether fattening birds for the sake of scrumptious livers amounts to ethical agriculture or torture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dadce5e2dcb3182a1e80d819d864e47f5286d0f8","amp;dn":"The+Foie+Gras+Wars%3A+How+a+5%2C000-Year-Old+Delicacy+Inspired+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dadce5e2dcb3182a1e80d819d864e47f5286d0f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,220,229,226,220,179,24,42,30,128,216,25,216,100,228,127,82,134,208,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
