Early experiences (playing with blocks with his grandmother, drawing with his father, hearing Alvar Aalto lecture), discovering computer-assisted design, finding a psychoanalyst, experimenting on his own home, and bringing an artist and sculptor&amp;#039;s sensibility to architecture are part of Gehry&amp;#039;s story. Friends, artists, critics, and curators comment.\n\nHigh quality h.264 encoded file suitable for iPod touch/iPhone/iTunes.
