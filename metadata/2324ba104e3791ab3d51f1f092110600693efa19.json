Yay!\n\nWHO ARE TOSH?\n\nHawkwind probably are one of the few bands who run their own tribute band! In 2008, the core of TOSH was Mr Dibs' band Spacehead, and they kicked things off at this show. Then, for tracks 4, 5 and 6, Brock and other Hawks took to the stage. During Virgin of the World the personnel reverted mainly to Spacehead, but Brock came back for part of Brainstorm, and later for Ejection.\n\n\nPERSONNEL:\n\nMr Dibs - bass, vox\nDave Brock - guitar (4, 5, 6, 8, 13)\nRichard Chadwick  - drums (4, 5 ,6)\nMr E? - drums on rest.\nKeef Barton - vox (track 9), guitar, keys\nJason Stuart - keys (4, 5, 6, 8)\nTim Blake - Theramin, some tracks.\nMr Floyd - synths.\n\nThanks to Graham P, writing on Starfarer's site (http://www.starfarer.net/hf08bygp.html) for some of the info on who played what.\n\n\nTRACKS:\n\n01 Life Form\n02 Master of the Universe\n02 Void City\n04 Needle Gun\n05 Golden Void\n06 Psi Power\n07 Virgin of the World\n08 Brainstorm\n09 Infinity\n10 Valium 10\n11 Forge of Vulcan\n12 You'd Better Believe It\n13 Ejection\n\nThanx to Bernhard, owner of probably the biggest Hawkwind bootleg archive in the world, for sending me this CD! Technically (no pun intended) this isn't Hawkwind, but I still think of this as a Hawks gig.\n\n\nHAWKFEST 2008\n\nHawkfest is a private Hawkwind festival, limited to around 1000 Hawkwind passport-holders. Anyone in the UK will remember how crap the summer was, but the Hawkfest weekend was really hot and sunny!\n\nYou can read more about Hawkfest on Starfarer's site, so all I'll say here is I spent hours getting pissed and stoned each day, and falling asleep at inconvenient times (like when Huw Lloyd-Langton played, and then Tim Blake) but I had a great time and didn't miss Hawkwind (Sat) and TOSH (Sun).\n\nI'll post the FLAC files on Dime in a day or two... these MP3s are for those who can't sign up to dimeadozen.org or who have restricted download bandwidth.\n\nShare and enjoy.
