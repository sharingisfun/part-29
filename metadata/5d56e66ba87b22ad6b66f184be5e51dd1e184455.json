Perkins called this scholarly\nyet super-readable volume &quot;marvelously researched and\nirresistible ... required reading not only for Psycho-philes,\nbut also for anyone interested in the backstage world of\nmovie creation.&quot; And Time critic Richard Schickel (biographer\nof Clint Eastwood) calls Rebello's book &quot;one of the best\naccounts of the making of an individual movie we've ever had.&quot;\n\nIt's even more reliable than Francois Truffaut's magisterial\ninterview book Hitchcock, because Rebello interviewed the fat\nmaster himself, plus many Psycho insiders less cagey and truth\ndodging than he.\n\nAt last, thanks to Rebello, we know all about the celebrated\nshower murder scene and all that swirls around it. Like Ernst\nLubitsch, who conveyed the thrill of adultery by having the\nlovers open a door and cast their shadows on a bed, Hitchcock\nknew that, in film, artful discretion can be the most shocking\neffect of all. --Tim Appelo\n\n\n\nAlfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho\nby Stephen Rebello\nLanguage: EN\nPages: PDF 960 - EPUB 474","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d56e66ba87b22ad6b66f184be5e51dd1e184455","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock+and+the+Making+of+Psycho++by+Stephen+Rebello","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d56e66ba87b22ad6b66f184be5e51dd1e184455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,86,230,107,168,123,34,173,107,102,241,132,190,94,81,221,30,24,68,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
