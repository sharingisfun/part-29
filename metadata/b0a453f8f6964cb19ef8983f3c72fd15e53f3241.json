Pip must establish his own sense of self against the plans which others seem to have for him, and thus discover a firm set of values and priorities. Whether such values will allow one to prosper in the complex world of early Victorian England is, however, the major question posed by Great Expectations, one of Dickens's most fascinating and disturbing novels.\n\nThe main theme of the book revolves around the nature of what constitutes a 'gentleman'. Pip believes initially that a gentleman is an individual with wealth, fine clothes and preferably a title, however he realises by the end of the novel that true gentleman, as epitomized by Joe the blacksmith, are defined as such by their character and decency and not by the clothes they wear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0a453f8f6964cb19ef8983f3c72fd15e53f3241","amp;dn":"Charles+Dickens+-+Great+Expectations+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0a453f8f6964cb19ef8983f3c72fd15e53f3241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,164,83,248,246,150,76,177,158,248,152,63,60,114,253,21,229,63,50,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
