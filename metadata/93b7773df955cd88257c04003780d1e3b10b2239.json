Ant updates us on a Gavin McInnes article and the repercussions he caught from it, he take a few agreeing and opposing calls on the topic, plays some viral &quot;ice bucket&quot; challenge videos and then, ogles a new Jess Greenberg song. He wraps up the show talking about Belle Knox, a new video game you'll want to get in on, and takes a few more listener calls.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b7773df955cd88257c04003780d1e3b10b2239","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-21+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b7773df955cd88257c04003780d1e3b10b2239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,183,119,61,249,85,205,136,37,124,4,0,55,128,209,227,177,11,34,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
