Learn new tools, tricks, and techniques, including two-sided binding for two-sided quilts and satin stitching that is sure to impress!\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/wbgden105/Wendy_and_Pat.jpg\r\nPat Pease started the creative process at an early age, under the guidance of her craftsman father.
