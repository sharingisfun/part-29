In 1995 the festival found itself in a similar situation until Metallica agreed to play with the condition of the band having control over the event and naming it &quot;Escape from the Studio&quot;. In 1996 Ozzy Osbourne and KISS co-headlined the festival and although plans to extend the festival into a two-day event in 1997, the promoters once again found themselves in a struggle for headliners and the event was cancelled and discontinued.\r\n\r\nDonington Park remained event-less until 2001 when the Rock and Blues Festival and Stereophonics held events at the site. In 2002 the Ozzfest tour returned to the UK using Donington Park as their only British event and the following year Live Nation picked up the reins as Monsters of Rock's successor in the name of Download Festival. An outstanding success from the offset, the festival continues to this day having increased to a three-day event with five stages, though as of 2008 the event has been relegated outside of the track.\r\n\r\n16 August 1986\r\n\r\n    Ozzy Osbourne\r\n    Scorpions\r\n    Def Leppard\r\n    Motorhead\r\n    Warlock\r\n    Bad News\r\n    Tommy Vance (DJ)\r\n\r\nOzzy's Set: \r\n\r\nYear:\t1986\r\nStyle:\tHeavy Metal\r\nAdditional:\tHard &amp; Heavy\r\nCountry:\tUnited Kingdom\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t111.52 MB\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t23/02/2016 \r\nFiles:\t12\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\nLength : 0:48:38\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n01.
