It is the first film in the American Pie theatrical series. The film was a box-office hit and spawned three direct sequels: American Pie 2 (2001), American Wedding (2003), and American Reunion (2012).[3] The film concentrates on five boys (Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch, and Stifler) who attend East Great Falls High. With the exception of Stifler (who has already lost his virginity), the other four make a pact to lose their virginity before their high school graduation. The title is borrowed from the folk song of the same name and refers to a scene in the film, in which the lead character is caught masturbating with a pie after being told that third base feels like &quot;warm apple pie&quot;. It's also been stated by writer Adam Herz that the title also refers to the quest of losing your virginity in high school, which is as &quot;American as apple pie.&quot;\n\nThe film's theme song is Laid by James, which is also the theme for the entire franchise.\n\nIn addition to the primary American Pie saga, there are currently four direct-to-DVD spin-off films bearing the title American Pie Presents: Band Camp (2005), The Naked Mile (2006), Beta House (2007), and The Book of Love (2009).\n\nIn response to the success of American Reunion, a fifth theatrical film, under the working title &quot;American Pie 5&quot; was announced on August 4, 2012.[4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa27efc465982adb07c86f55b69e59e0268f32f9","amp;dn":"American+Pie+%5B1999%5D+DVD9+PAL+ENG+GER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa27efc465982adb07c86f55b69e59e0268f32f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,39,239,196,101,152,42,219,7,200,111,85,182,158,89,224,38,143,50,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
