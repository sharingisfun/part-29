Thanks!\n\nArtist/Album Info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow%27s_Harvest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow%27s_Harvest&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==============================\nThis is a 4 side (A, B, C, D) FLAC vinyl recording of Boards Of Canada - Tomorrow's Harvest\n\nINFO:\n\n2566 KBit/s\nSample Rate of 96000 Hz\nStereo (of course)\nflac 24 bit depth\n\nI recorded this to share, not for convenience. What I mean is there are 4 sides to this album, thus I recorded 4 total times = 4 tracks. If you want to separate the tracks into individual songs then please do so.\n\nI used Audacity, a free open source audio editor. It's pretty basic but good for this sort of thing.\n\nBrand new records and needle were used. This is literally the first play of these records. And I tried to keep all impurities off the records and needle.\n\nTurntable used was a Realistic LAB-500 Fully Automatic Direct Drive connected directly to stereo inputs of my computer. I monitored (listened) to it as it played, so I could hear any problems. \n\nOverall I'd say really good quality.\n\nEnjoy, Comment, Seed!\n\n================================\n\nTrack List for this album:\n\nSide A:\n1. Gemini\n2. Reach For The Dead\n3. White Cyclosa\n4. Jacquard Causeway\n\nSide B:\n1. Telepath\n2. Cold Earth\n3. Transmisions Ferox\n4. Sick Times\n\nSide C:\n1. Palace Posy\n2.
