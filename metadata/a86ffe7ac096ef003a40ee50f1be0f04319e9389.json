The discovery of the scrolls has added dramatically to our understanding of the varieties of Judaism at the time of Jesus and the rise of Christianity, but has also promoted heated debate about the nature of these religions. As the monumental task of transcribing and translating the Dead Sea Scrolls is finally completed, people around the world are taking stock of the significance of these ancient documents. In this study, one of the world's foremost experts on the scrolls reveals the complete and fascinating story in all its detail: the amazing discovery, the intense controversies, and the significant revelations.\n\nThis Generation: Resolving The Olivet Discourse - DVD\n\nDescription\n\nIt is ironic that Jesus' opening imperative in His &quot;Olivet Discourse&quot; is &quot;Take heed that no man deceive you&quot;. This is His command, but it begs a question of means: &quot;How do we avoid that?&quot; There seems to be more conjectures and misunderstandings over this passage than almost any other in the New Testament.\n\nFor many students of eschatology - the study of last things - the so-called Olivet Discourse has proven to be a troublesome passage; a hermeneutical battleground between the dispensationalists and the preterists, etc. The preterists insist that this passage - and the Book of Revelation - has been already fulfilled, and much of it is dismissed by them as simply allegorical. Yet even those who embrace a dispensational view have difficulty reconciling many of the Olivet Discourse passages.\n\nOur exploration of this passage will challenge more than simply our hermeneutics alone. It will challenge our grasp of the whole eschatological plan in its entirety.\n\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n                                             \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a86ffe7ac096ef003a40ee50f1be0f04319e9389","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Chuck+Missler+-+Resolving+The+Olivet+Discourse+-+Dead+Se","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a86ffe7ac096ef003a40ee50f1be0f04319e9389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,111,254,122,192,150,239,0,58,64,238,80,241,190,15,4,49,158,147,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
