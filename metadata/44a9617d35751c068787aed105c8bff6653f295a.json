Well, it is not. Speedy Joe's files are all 'mp4' format and so the videos are good even in small files. If you ask me, I would give this a rating of 10 in Audio and 8 in Video. For best results, use VLC Player.\n( http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc/ )\n\nMore Information: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.animecrazy.net/ao-no-exorcist-anime/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.animecrazy.net/ao-no-exorcist-anime/&lt;/a&gt;\n=================\n\nOfficial Website: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.blueexorcist.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.blueexorcist.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n=================\n\nPlease Seed...\n\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44a9617d35751c068787aed105c8bff6653f295a","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Exorcist+Ep.25+%28Eng+Sub%29%28Speedy+Joe%29+%5Bimsourav%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44a9617d35751c068787aed105c8bff6653f295a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,169,97,125,53,117,28,6,135,135,174,209,5,200,191,246,101,63,41,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
