It was released both as a single album and as a double album (known as AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector\\'s Edition). The album is supported by a video, AC/DC: Live at Donington.[1]\n\nAC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector\\'s Edition was released a month after the single-disc version, in a slipcased two-disc \\&quot;book\\&quot; (similar in shape to old CD longboxes) and containing an AC/DC dollar note.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.\n\nThe recordings on this disc are taken from several shows from AC/DC\\'s 1991 The Razors Edge tour. Most of the recordings are from the Donington &amp; Moscow \\&quot;Monsters of Rock\\&quot; shows, and some from other various shows from the tour.\n\nTrack listings\n\n2 CD \\&quot;Collector\\'s Edition\\&quot;\n\nDisc one\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\n\n1. \t\\&quot;Thunderstruck\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young \t6:34\n2. \t\\&quot;Shoot to Thrill\\&quot;   \t  \t5:21\n3. \t\\&quot;Back in Black\\&quot;   \t  \t4:28\n4. \t\\&quot;Sin City\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t5:40\n5. \t\\&quot;Who Made Who\\&quot;   \t  \t5:16\n6. \t\\&quot;Heatseeker\\&quot;   \t  \t3:37\n7. \t\\&quot;Fire Your Guns\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young \t3:42\n8. \t\\&quot;Jailbreak\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t14:04\n9. \t\\&quot;The Jack\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t6:57\n10. \t\\&quot;The Razors Edge\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young \t4:36\n11. \t\\&quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t5:03\n12. \t\\&quot;Moneytalks\\&quot; (Not available on vinyl) \tYoung, Young \t4:20\n\nDisc two\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\n\n1. \t\\&quot;Hells Bells\\&quot;   \t  \t6:01\n2. \t\\&quot;Are You Ready\\&quot; (Not available on vinyl) \tYoung, Young \t4:34\n3. \t\\&quot;That\\'s the Way I Wanna Rock \\'n\\' Roll\\&quot;   \t  \t3:57\n4. \t\\&quot;High Voltage\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t10:32\n5. \t\\&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long\\&quot;   \t  \t3:54\n6. \t\\&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t4:30\n7. \t\\&quot;Let There Be Rock\\&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t12:17\n8. \t\\&quot;Bonny\\&quot; (Not available on vinyl) \tTrad. arr.
