He toured with the Rolling Stones and had an \ninternational hit with a duet with Mick Jagger, then toured again to \nequally rapturous world audiences as the headlining act. His words \nwould cause an uproar at the One Peace concert, but then unlike \nfellow Wailer Bob Marley, Tosh always made his true feelings known. \nHe was born Winston Hubert McIntosh on October 19, 1944, in the small \nrural village of Grange Hill, Jamaica. Like so many young island \nteens searching for a better life, he left home at 15 and headed for \nKingston. Once there, he made his way to Joe Higgs' tenement yard, \njoining other aspiring youths eager for the vocal coaching lessons \nthe singing star provided to local teens. Amongst these youthful \nwannabes were Bunny, Bob Marley, and the much younger Junior \nBraithwaite; the four, buttressed by backing vocalists Cherry Green \nand Beverley Kelso, joined forces initially as the Teenagers before \neventually settling on the moniker the Wailers. \n\n\nTrack Listings:\n\n1.
