During his lifetime he earned a reputation as a leading humanist scholar. More coined the word &quot;utopia&quot;, a name he gave to an ideal, imaginary island nation whose political system he described in a book published in 1516.\nThis book is all about the fictional country called Utopia. It is a country with an Ã¢â‚¬ËœidealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ form of communism, in which everything really does belong to everybody, everyone does the work they want to, and everyone is alright with that. This country uses gold for chamber pots and prison chains, pearls and diamonds for childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playthings, and requires that a man and a woman see each other exactly as they are, naked, before getting married. This book gave the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœutopiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the meaning of a perfect society, while the Greek word actually means Ã¢â‚¬Ëœno placeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc3454e7292f7728441a95cefd06189e91fd4f7c","amp;dn":"Utopia+by+Saint+Sir+Thomas+More+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc3454e7292f7728441a95cefd06189e91fd4f7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,52,84,231,41,47,119,40,68,26,149,206,253,6,24,158,145,253,79,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
