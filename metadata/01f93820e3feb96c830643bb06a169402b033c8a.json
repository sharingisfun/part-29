This may be a secular tune, but it fits snugly next to the rest of Home for Christmas, as that holiday record was designed as a slow, soulful stroll through seasonal classics, Crow turning in excellent versions of tunes as diverse as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGo Tell It on the Mountain,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Be Home for Christmas.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Crow doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t necessarily reinvent these songs -- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMerry Christmas BabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is taken at a slightly faster gait than usual, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhite ChristmasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ grooves like classic Stax -- but she does inhabit them and her band is tight and dexterous, giving this Christmas album some unexpected and welcome soul. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a good enough holiday album that it shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be thought of as a thrown-off exclusive: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the better pop Christmas records of the last half of the 2000s. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01f93820e3feb96c830643bb06a169402b033c8a","amp;dn":"Sheryl+Crow+-+Home+for+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01f93820e3feb96c830643bb06a169402b033c8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,249,56,32,227,254,185,108,131,6,67,187,6,161,105,64,43,3,60,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
