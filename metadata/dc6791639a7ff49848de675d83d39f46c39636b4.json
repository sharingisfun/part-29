The arrangements are also a little different than Cotton's norm, tending as they do towards late '70s funk, in particular on songs like &quot;Part Time Love&quot; and &quot;Hard Headed.&quot;\n\nThere's still plenty of straight blues here, however, including &quot;When it Rains it Pours,&quot; and Cotton is in terrific vocal form throughout, particularly on a blistering version of Muddy Waters' &quot;Born in Chicago.&quot; Meanwhile, his harp work is especially fiery on the concluding instrumental &quot;The Midnight Creeper,&quot; a de facto tribute to Little Walter.\n\nRecorded at Biddy Milligan's, Chicago, Illinois from February 1-3, 1986.\n\nJames Cotton (vocals, harmonica); Michael Coleman (guitar); Douglas Fagen (tenor saxophone); Danny &quot;Boney&quot; Fields (trumpet); Johnny Cotton (trombone); Eddie Harsch (piano); Noel Neal (bass); Ray &quot;Killer&quot; Allison (drums).\n\n\n\n1.Here I Am (Knocking at Your Door)\n2.Part Time Love \n3.Just to Be With You \n4.Hard Headed \n5.When It Rains It Pours \n6.Cross Your Heart \n7.Come Back, Baby   \n8.Born in Chicago   \n9 The Midnight Creeper \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc6791639a7ff49848de675d83d39f46c39636b4","amp;dn":"James+Cotton+Live+From+Chicago+Mr+Superharp+Himself%28blues%299mp3%403","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc6791639a7ff49848de675d83d39f46c39636b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,103,145,99,154,127,244,152,72,222,103,93,131,211,159,70,195,150,54,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
