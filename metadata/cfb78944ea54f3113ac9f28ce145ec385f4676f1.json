The use of Gossip&amp;#039;s\n&amp;#039;Standing In The Way Of Control&amp;#039; and Bloc Party&amp;#039;s\n&amp;#039;Positive Tension&amp;#039; has won us over at 4Music and now you\ncan own all the top tracks from the show on one handy CD.\n\nBut wait is there a great bonus track you can only get on\nthis album? Yes it&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Wild World&amp;#039; sung by cast member Mike\nBailey who plays lovelorn Sid, the guy who can&amp;#039;t lose his\nvirginity. The song is a cover of the classic Cat Stevens\ntrack, which interestingly re-entered the Top 40 earlier\nthis year on the back of it being sung on the show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfb78944ea54f3113ac9f28ce145ec385f4676f1","amp;dn":"VA-Skins_The_Soundtrack-2007-SAW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfb78944ea54f3113ac9f28ce145ec385f4676f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,183,137,68,234,84,243,17,58,201,242,140,225,69,236,56,95,70,118,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
