Two teams of celebrities answer questions about\npop music, guess songs after hearing their teammates sing the intros, and try\nto find the former popstar hidden in a lineup of look-alikes.\n \n Guests on the show are frequently the targets for pointed jokes about their\ncareers or public personas. Both longtime hosts Mark Lamarr and Simon Amstell\nfostered an atmosphere of playful hostility (although Amstell was criticized\nfor taking this too far). Now that the show has moved to a format with a new\nguest host every week, much of the mocking comes in the form of the host's\njokes at his own expense.\n \n Phill Jupitus has been a team captain since the show's inception, with Sean\nHughes, Bill Bailey, and current captain Noel Fielding playing the part of his\nrival.\n\n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68a5f5fcc1f1492c8598a08ae6d73729679b1876","amp;dn":"Never.Mind.The.Buzzcocks.UK.S28E08.HDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68a5f5fcc1f1492c8598a08ae6d73729679b1876","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,165,245,252,193,241,73,44,133,152,160,138,230,215,55,41,103,155,24,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
