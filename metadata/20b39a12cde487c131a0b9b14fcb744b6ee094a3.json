This comic is kind of cool. It's filled with underground comics style advertisements for Clearlake and the surrounding area, but they're legit. Some of them are probably still there today. It's also pro-environment and tells the story of a 'monster' that lives in Clearlake. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearlake,_California&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearlake,_California&lt;/a&gt;\n\nClearlake is a city in Lake County, California. Clearlake is 4.5 miles (7.2 km) north-northwest of Lower Lake, at an elevation of 1417 feet (432 m). As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 15,250, up from 13,142 at the 2000 census.\n\nClearlake is fairly unique in California, in that almost half of its central urban roads are unpaved. According to a 2012 road survey, 44% of the cities roads are unpaved, including dozens of miles of urban residential streets. Almost all of the streets east of Hwy 53 in Clearlake are unpaved. The unmaintained nature of these streets leads to difficulties in access to the homes of thousands of residents.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20b39a12cde487c131a0b9b14fcb744b6ee094a3","amp;dn":"Clearlake+Comix+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20b39a12cde487c131a0b9b14fcb744b6ee094a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,179,154,18,205,228,135,193,49,160,185,177,79,203,116,75,110,224,148,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
