Building from Run-D.M.C.'s              |\n|  street-oriented beats and Boogie Down Productions' proto-gangsta          |\n|  rhyming, Public Enemy pioneered a variation of hardcore rap that was      |\n|  musically and politically revolutionary. With his powerful,               |\n|  authoritative baritone, lead rapper Chuck D rhymed about all kinds of     |\n|  social problems, particularly those plaguing the black community, often   |\n|  condoning revolutionary tactics and social activism. In the process, he   |\n|  directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black               |\n|  consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next     |\n|  decade. Musically, Public Enemy were just as revolutionary, as their      |\n|  production team, the Bomb Squad, created dense soundscapes that relied    |\n|  on avant-garde cut-and-paste techniques, unrecognizable samples,          |\n|  piercing sirens, relentless beats, and deep funk. It was chaotic and      |\n|  invigorating music, made all the more intoxicating by Chuck D's forceful  |\n|  vocals and the absurdist raps of his comic foil Flavor Flav. With his     |\n|  comic sunglasses and an oversized clock hanging from his neck, Flav       |\n|  became the group's visual focal point, but he never obscured the music.   |\n|  While rap and rock critics embraced the group's late-'80s and early-'90s  |\n|  records, Public Enemy frequently ran into controversy with their          |\n|  militant stance and lyrics, especially after their 1988 album, It Takes   |\n|  a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, made them into celebrities. After   |\n|  all the controversy settled in the early '90s, once the group entered a   |\n|  hiatus, it became clear that Public Enemy were the most influential and   |\n|  radical band of their time.                                               |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce400539feecc3c548b2711b9f5a5fa71884c7a0","amp;dn":"Public+Enemy+-+New+Whirl+Odor+%28Advance%29+-+2005+-+FM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce400539feecc3c548b2711b9f5a5fa71884c7a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,64,5,57,254,236,195,197,72,178,113,27,159,90,95,167,24,132,199,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
