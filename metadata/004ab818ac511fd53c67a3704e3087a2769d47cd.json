Yes it can, this one has and only zEROS can do it; the name is enough. (Ladies can PM me to know what that is!)\r\nIt can't be fully removed without washing out frames (which would mess up the HD details), but we at DDR have taken care of it and have minimized it by atleast 80% keeping the HD details intact.\r\nAs usual, brought out fine details which were muted in the source.\r\nThis film was shot with heavy film grains, we have kept it that way, it looks more natural and eye-pleasing.\r\nP.S.: The grains remained intact even after detail enhancing, they are not over-exploited; because we didn't sharpen the full frame, we just enhanced the fine details present in the frame (unlike the ladies).\r\nLuma was messed up here, heavy whites; we adjusted it. Minimal work done on chroma as well.\r\nAC3 audio along with spell-checked subtitles &amp; named chapters.\r\nAgain, DDR serves you with superior quality release. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nDesperate ladies, all gone? Forget me not. Psych!\r\nAnd, it ain't bragging, if it's true.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the information provided above are accurate and not tampered with, because we share what we show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004ab818ac511fd53c67a3704e3087a2769d47cd","amp;dn":"Welcome+Back+%282015%29+-+BluRay+-+720p+-+x264+-+AC3+%5BDDR-ExclusivE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004ab818ac511fd53c67a3704e3087a2769d47cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,74,184,24,172,81,31,213,60,103,163,112,78,48,135,162,118,157,71,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
