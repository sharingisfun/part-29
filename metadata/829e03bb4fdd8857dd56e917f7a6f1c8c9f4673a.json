The holidays are a time for celebration, but when Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and host of other Disney characters become obsessed with holiday preparations, the frenzy of activity leaves everyone feeling stressed, selfish, and full of regret. A skating contest leads best friends Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck down a path of jealousy and hurt feelings in &quot;Belles on Ice,&quot; and &quot;Christmas Impossible&quot; finds Huey, Dewie, and Louie selfishly scheming to get on Santa&amp;#039;s &quot;good list&quot; at any expense. In &quot;Christmas Maximus,&quot; Goofy&amp;#039;s son Max is mortified by his father&amp;#039;s silly antics and, in &quot;Donald&amp;#039;s Gift,&quot; Donald&amp;#039;s craving for peace and quiet threatens to ruin the whole family&amp;#039;s holiday fun. &quot;Mickey&amp;#039;s Dog-Gone Christmas&quot; finds Mickey so absorbed in planning the perfect Christmas party that he lashes out at Pluto and almost loses a very special friend forever. While the animation style is new, what hasn&amp;#039;t changed is Disney&amp;#039;s commitment to stories with wholesome values: Mickey and the gang remind viewers that the holiday season is not about selfishness, flashy parties, and expensive gifts, but about selflessness and the celebration of family and friends \n\n\nDisney&amp;#039;s Special Christmas at www.solodvd.org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:829e03bb4fdd8857dd56e917f7a6f1c8c9f4673a","amp;dn":"Mickey%5C%27s+Twice+Upon+a+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"829e03bb4fdd8857dd56e917f7a6f1c8c9f4673a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,158,3,187,79,221,136,87,221,86,233,23,247,166,241,200,201,244,103,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
