In doing so however the Nazis unwittingly assembled the finest escape team in military history-brilliantly portrayed here by Steve McQueen James Garner Charles Bronson and James Coburn-who worked on what became the largest prison breakout ever attempted. One of the most ingenious and suspenseful adventure films of all time &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is a masterful collaboration between director John Sturges (&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;) screenwriters James Clavell (&quot;Shogun&quot;) and W.R. Burnett (&quot;Little Caesar&quot;) and composer Elmer Bernstein. Based on a true story &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is epic entertainment.Starring: Steve McQueen James Garner and Richard Attenborough Director: John Sturges.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:580117bacccfe21f72669cfba4c2db3c50385275","amp;dn":"The+Great+Escape+%281962%29+-+Divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"580117bacccfe21f72669cfba4c2db3c50385275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,1,23,186,204,207,226,31,114,102,156,251,164,194,219,60,80,56,82,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
