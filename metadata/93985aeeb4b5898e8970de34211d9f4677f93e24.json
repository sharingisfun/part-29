Peasant Tuya (Yu Nan) is a happily married mother of two whose husband Bater is permanently disabled. One day, after hard-working Tuya collapses in the fields while straining to perform her rigorous duties, the local doctor diagnoses her with a lumbar dislocation. Subsequently unable to care for her invalid husband, Tuya and Bater agree to divorce so that the ailing woman can wed a husband capable of caring for both of them. Though several suitors throw their hat into the ring upon hearing that Tuya is available, each is immediately put off upon learning that Bater is part of the deal as well. The only man who seems willing to consider caring for both is divorced oil tycoon Baolier, who, as a smitten young schoolboy, was once good friends with the kindly Tuya. When a sudden tragedy strikes, threatening Bater&amp;#039;s life, however, Baolier&amp;#039;s true intentions open the door for Tuya&amp;#039;s cuckolded neighbor Sen&amp;#039;ge to step in and save the day. At first simply thankful for the benevolent intervention of the shy but likable Sen&amp;#039;ge, Tuya slowly begins to realize just how deep the lovelorn Sen&amp;#039;ge&amp;#039;s feelings for her truly run.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Tuya&amp;#039;s Marriage.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 700 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 1016 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 11.5 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 845 Kbps\n      Width : 592 pixels\n      Height : 320 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.850\n      Frame rate : 24.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.184\n      StreamSize : 577 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 163 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 111 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.96r\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nEnglish subs, softcoded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93985aeeb4b5898e8970de34211d9f4677f93e24","amp;dn":"Tuya%5C%27s+Marriage+%28Tuya+de+hun+shi%29+-+Quanan+Wang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93985aeeb4b5898e8970de34211d9f4677f93e24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,152,90,238,180,181,137,142,137,112,222,52,33,29,159,70,119,249,62,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
