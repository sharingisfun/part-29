When his host is killed in a riding accident Chuck realizes he must take care of the family. They hit the road and he takes a job on a ranch, but he has to keep the children hidden as his boss hates kids. There's also tension with the neighboring ranch, and when a girl on the run from her nasty uncle joins the family unannounced Chuck wonders what he has done to deserve all this.\n\nUser Review\n\nThis film deals lightly with quite an interesting subject: How much of a choice do you have in your life? McCrea wants the freedom of a life with no chains to anything, when suddenly he is in charge of taking care of four boys. This is not what he wants at all, but being a good man he just cannot abandon them. Wanda Hendrix is charming, at the beginning she looks like a young girl about the age of the boys, but then she becomes a beautiful woman. This excellent western, even though is quite predictable, makes you enjoy every minute of it.
