The latest versions of iPhoto and Aperture now share a common photo library format, which means you can store all your photos in one central library, and then switch between the two apps as needed: use iPhoto for its simplicity and great sharing options, and Aperture for its powerful organization, image editing, and publishing features.\n\nIn this course, photographer, author, and teacher Derrick Story shows key strategies for employing both iPhoto and Aperture in a digital photography workflow. The course begins with a look at the unified photo library format and managing your library with both applications. \n\nNext, the course examines the professional-level image editing features in Aperture and details strategies for sharing photos through slideshows and print projects, guiding you to the best application for the job at hand. It concludes with lessons on exporting photos using Aperture, managing an iCloud Photo Stream, and backing up your library.\nTopics include:\nSharing libraries\nImporting and exporting photos\nOrganizing your library\nEditing images\nBuilding slideshows\nCreating prints, cards, books, and calendars\nArchiving and back up your library","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd4252f6ad3aad852e8339910c4c54bee2ac4a4","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Using+iPhoto+and+Aperture+Together","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd4252f6ad3aad852e8339910c4c54bee2ac4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,212,37,47,106,211,170,216,82,232,51,153,16,196,197,75,238,42,196,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
