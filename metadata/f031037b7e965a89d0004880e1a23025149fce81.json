Several case studies are presented in a section devoted to applications, including assessments of:\nspark-ignition engines,\ndual-fuel engines,\nheavy duty and light duty diesel engines.\nThrough regression analysis, optimization results are used to explain complex interactions between engine design parameters, such as nozzle design, injection timing, swirl, exhaust gas recirculation, bore size, and piston bowl shape.\nComputational Optimization of Internal Combustion Engines demonstrates that the current multi-dimensional CFD tools are mature enough for practical development of internal combustion engines. It is written for researchers and designers in mechanical engineering and the automotive industry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f031037b7e965a89d0004880e1a23025149fce81","amp;dn":"Computational+Optimization+of+Internal+Combustion+Engines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f031037b7e965a89d0004880e1a23025149fce81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,49,3,123,126,150,90,137,208,0,72,128,225,162,48,37,20,159,206,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
