I thought I'd upload this even though it is an older seminar since it is so amazing.  Rob Bell is the seminar speaker/teacher. It's called: The Revolutionary Voice - becoming the kind of person people need to hear.\n\nThe seminar was 8 hours long.  The files are MP3 that I ripped from the seminar CD's that I purchased.  \n\nAny questions feel free to send me a message.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3af8eff11dcce6bb57fc7456964518f28732c2b1","amp;dn":"Rob+Bell+-+Revolutionary+Voice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3af8eff11dcce6bb57fc7456964518f28732c2b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,248,239,241,29,204,230,187,87,252,116,86,150,69,24,242,135,50,194,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
