I urge every true Christian to come out of her.(Revelation 18:1-8) Giving rise to the KJV Bible and during the Reformation movement, this is what most Preachers taught regarding Antichrist 1522 Martin Luther, 1536 Jean Calvin, 1543 Phillip Melanchthon, 1545 Andreas; whose purpose was to expose the RCC corruption and balsphemies while giving more scriptural knowledge to the plow farmer than possessed by the Pope.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nRome's Islam:\nDuring the Second Vatican Council, Dr. Rivera was taken deep beneath the Vatican to the Secret Archives, where all the history of the world for the past 2000 years is stored.
