Later, while attending a nightclub with her best and only friend Simon Lewis (Robert Sheehan), Clary witnesses the murder of a man by the hands of Jace Wayland (Jamie Campbell Bower), whom appears only Clary is able to see. Meanwhile, Jocelyn is abducted by two men, Emil Pangborn (Kevin Durand) and Samuel Blackwell (Robert Maillet), and they leave a message for Clary warning her that someone named Valentine is coming after her, then drinks a potion that leaves her in a comatose state. Returning home, Clary is attacked by a demon and rescued by Jace, who reveals himself to be a Shadowhunter, a warrior trained to slay demons hidden on Earth, such as the man in the nightclub. Jocelyn was a Shadowhunter as well, and Clary has inherited her powers, including the ability to use runes.\nClary and Jace visit Clary's neighbor and friend of her mother, Madame Dorothea (C. C. H. Pounder), a witch who deduces that Pangborn and Blackwell are after the Mortal Cup, one of the three Mortal Instruments given to the first Shadowhunter by the Angel Raziel, that allows normal humans to become half-Angel Shadowhunters. Simon, now able to see Jace, joins them as they leave to meet Luke in his bookstore. There, they discover that Luke is being interrogated by Pangborn and Blackwell, stating that he cares nothing for Jocelyn, and is after the Mortal Cup himself. The trio then escapes to the Shadowhunters' base of operations, the Institute, where Clary and Simon meet Jace's fellow Shadowhunters, Alec Lightwood (Kevin Zegers) and Isabelle Lightwood (Jemima West), and their leader, Hodge Starkweather (Jared Harris), who reveals that Pangborn and Blackwell are working for Valentine Morgenstern (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an ex-Shadowhunter who betrayed the race of the Nephilim and sought to steal the Mortal Cup to gain control over all Shadowhunters and demons.\nBelieving the key to find the Mortal Cup lies within Clary's mind, Hodge instructs Jace to take Clary to the City of Bones, where fallen Shadowhunters are laid to rest, to meet Brother Jeremiah (Stephen R. Hart), a member of the Silent Brothers who probe Clary's mind and uncover her connection to a powerful warlock, Magnus Bane (Godfrey Gao). Clary, Jace, Simon, Alec and Isabelle meet Magnus in a nightclub, where he reveals that Jocelyn has hired him to block knowledge of the Shadowhunters from Clary's mind. Their conversation is interrupted when Simon is kidnapped by vampires, leading to a confrontation in a nearby hotel. Their group is nearly killed until the werewolves (that share a truce with the Shadowhunters) intervene and rescue them.\nBack in the Institute, Clary shares a moment of romance with Jace during a romantic evening with him in the Institute's greenhouse, sharing a kiss. Simon confronts Clary about it and Jace gets angry and confused when she refers to it as just a kiss. Simon pours out his heart to Clary and Simon leaves the room leaving Clary feeling guilty.\nClary discovers that the Mortal Cup is hidden inside a tarot card painted by her mother, so the group returns to Madame Dorothea's apartment to retrieve it. There, they discover the witch has been replaced by a demon sent to steal the Cup. It is killed by Simon and Jace, not before critically wounding Alec, while Clary retrieves the Mortal Cup.\nThe group returns to the Institute only to find that they have been betrayed by Hodge, who takes the Mortal Cup from Clary and summons Valentine Morgenstern. He reveals himself to be Clary's father and persuades her to join him in his cause, but she refuses and escapes with help from Luke, who is revealed to be a werewolf. Luke tells Clary that she has a brother called Jonathan, and returns to the Institute with her and his pack to fight Valentine, who uses a forbidden spell to open a portal and summon an army of demons to New York. Simon and Isabelle manage to close the portal with help from Hodge, who sees the error of his ways and sacrifices himself to kill Blackwell. Meanwhile, Magnus arrives to heal the injured Alec, and Luke kills Pangborn.\nClary and Jace fight Valentine, who reveals that they are siblings, and that Jace's real name is Jonathan. He once more attempts to convince them to join him, but they refuse again and push him through the portal with a false Mortal Cup, and after a brief struggle the portal is destroyed by Jace. Jocelyn is rescued but remains in a coma at the hospital, where Luke accompanies her. Clary assures Simon that although she does not love him back, but somebody will. Clary heads back home and uses her powers to repair the damage done to her apartment. Shortly thereafter, Jace appears, confessing that he needs her and wants her to come back with him to the Institute. Without much thought, she agrees to go with him.\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76a36d2e27042114dddcc913eadebc0c9b9f6512","amp;dn":"The+Mortal+Instruments%3A+City.of.Bones.2013.1080p.BluRay.x264+.+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76a36d2e27042114dddcc913eadebc0c9b9f6512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,163,109,46,39,4,33,20,221,220,201,19,234,222,188,12,155,159,101,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
