As John and Paul introduce each guest we see a variety of classic Lennon/McCartney compositions performed, some which the Beatles themselves never recorded; 'World Without Love' (Peter &amp; Gordon), 'It's For You' (Cilla Black) and 'Bad To Me' (Billy J. Kramer &amp; The Dakotas).\n\n\nThe more familiar Lennon/McCartney compostions are given an interesting twist; 'I Saw Him Standing There' (Lulu), 'From Me to You' (British jazz organist Alan Haven &amp; drummer Tony Crombie), 'She Loves You'/medley (Fritz Spiegel's Ensemble), 'Yesterday' (duet with Paul &amp; Marianne Faithful), 'She Loves You' (Antonio Vargas), 'Things We Said Today' ( sung in French by Dick Rivers), 'Ringo's Theme [This Boy]' (the George Martin Orchestra), 'If I Fell' (Henry Mancini) and 'And I Love Him' (Esther Phillips). Then there is Peter Sellers as Shakespeare's Richard III giving a wildly amusing rendition of 'A Hard Day's Night' and the Beatles performing (well, miming!) 'Day Tripper' and 'We Can Work It Out' (with John on harmonium).\n\n\nSome have suggested this is an optical conversion from 405-625, i.e. they pointed a 625 camera at a 405 monitor, this was quite common in the pre-digital age! That would account for the slight smeariness of the picture and the soft definition.\n\n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name: The Music of Lennon and McCartney Xvid AC3.avi\nFile Size: 460,873,486 bytes\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration: 43:54.000\nVideo Bitrate: 1196kb/s\nBits / Pixel: 0.121\nResolution: 696x568\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\n\n--- Advanced ---\nB-VOP: B-VOP\nQPel:\nGMC:\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nNo of Audio Streams\n: 1\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Channel Count: 2\nInterleave: 40ms\nPreload: ms\nAudio alignment: Aligned","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da5cd51d615e1fc1a4de0e581fbc6be13929b11","amp;dn":"The+Music+of+Lennon+and+McCartney+1965+Granada+ITV+Xvid+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da5cd51d615e1fc1a4de0e581fbc6be13929b11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,165,205,81,214,21,225,252,26,77,224,229,129,251,198,190,19,146,155,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
