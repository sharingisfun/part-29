To this end, he recruits the aid of his (previously unmentioned) daughter (Lisa Zane). However, she discovers the demonic origin of her father's powers and meets Daddy Krueger head-on for a final showdown. \n\nNow why is this special in the least? Because when this was in U.S. theaters in September of '91, it ran 100 minutes in length. However, when it appeared on VHS the following year, it had been cut down to 88 minutes and it is this version that would appear on further home video formats (laserdisc, DVD, blu ray). This is a reconstruction of that theatrical version (missing at least one sequence though that cannot be found through any source). The German version of the movie used many (but not all) of the scenes that were cut out of home video edition.\n\nThe actual length of this is 98 minutes, due to many PAL sources having to be used (PAL sources are sped up when converted to NTSC). It's not complete and some of the footage is of awful quality, but until New Line fesses up and releases their original full length version, this is the best we've got.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/fwzvg0v0z/Thumbs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/fwzvg0v0z/Thumbs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5c806fe93bb6f7160a9bb86f3984aa6d3aaae79","amp;dn":"Freddy%27s+Dead+Theatrical+Version.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5c806fe93bb6f7160a9bb86f3984aa6d3aaae79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,200,6,254,147,187,111,113,96,169,187,134,243,152,74,166,211,170,174,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
