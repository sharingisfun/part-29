It was originally recorded by Swedish National Radio for a radio show called Tonkraft at the Stockholm Konserthuset on 12 November 1970, but not released until 1988. The tapes were re-mixed by Tom Leader at Angel Studios in London. It remains the prime example of the early Mk II set list and ferocious concert dynamics. The set list comprises songs from the album Deep Purple in Rock and long instrumentals from earlier albums. The two songs &quot;Mandrake Root&quot; and &quot;Wring that Neck&quot; took up half the concert in the early days, until the Fireball tour.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n        &quot;Speed King&quot;   \t      \n \t&quot;Into the Fire&quot;   \t\n \t&quot;Child in Time&quot;   \t\n \t&quot;Wring That Neck&quot;   \t\n \t&quot;Paint It, Black&quot;   \t\n \t&quot;Mandrake Root&quot;   \t\n \t&quot;Black Night&quot;   \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c098c0e704b16b6095a053caffac23b3deef021","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Scandinavian+Nights+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c098c0e704b16b6095a053caffac23b3deef021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,9,140,14,112,75,22,182,9,90,5,60,175,250,194,59,61,238,240,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
