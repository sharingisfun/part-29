The results of this symposium clearly demonstrated that a substantial progress could be reported in the application of both conventional and new analytical techniques, the latter essentially based on natural analytical tools such as biomolecules. The main themes covered during this meeting are fermentation monitoring, chromatography, instrumental analysis, biosensors and bioanalysis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ecbec4c3158051157eabd8a04e6bcd92bcda789","amp;dn":"Analytical+Biotechnology+-+C.+van+Dijk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ecbec4c3158051157eabd8a04e6bcd92bcda789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,203,236,76,49,88,5,17,87,234,189,138,4,230,188,217,43,205,167,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
