His Poetics of Cinema 2 &amp; 3 is made up of parodies and conceptual simulations. It proposes a working model for the writing of films, and then is composed of exercises and formulae that propose a method of filming. As Ruiz writes, A shot is equally a paradigm and an allegory. / A self-reflexive (and critical) image. Centripetal and centrifugal. It alludes to and synthesizes the totality of shots and the stories they tell, that is to say, it is holistic. It has combinatory potentiality. It will not always be internally coherent with the shots that precede or follow it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d3b27743cd80e15308329380adb40707baec9f","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2007%5D+Poetics+of+Cinema+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d3b27743cd80e15308329380adb40707baec9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,211,178,119,67,205,128,225,83,8,50,147,128,173,180,7,7,186,236,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
