Quarks come in different types. There are six different types: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom. For example, a proton is comprised of two up quarks and one down quark. Quarks have electric charge, color charge, spin and mass. But they have no internal structure, they behave like mathematical points.\n\nElectrons are members of the lepton family. Like the quarks, leptons are also point particles. \n\nContent: Craig.Ferguson.2010.04.05.Kristen.Bell.[quark].mp4\n                Size: 44,636,916 bytes (42.569 MB)\n                Play duration: 00:39:55 (2394.905 s)\n                Container type: MP4/MOV\n\n      The.Colbert.Report.2010.04.05.Dean.Kamen.H264[quark].mp4\n                Size: 24,013,249 bytes (22.901 MB)\n                Play duration: 00:21:29 (1289.45 s)\n               Container type: MP4/MOV\n\n    The.Daily.Show.2010.04.05.Reza.Aslan.H264[quark].mp4\n                Size: 24,019,128 bytes (22.906 MB)\n               Play duration: 00:21:29 (1288.985 s)\n               Container type: MP4/MOV\n\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCompatible brands: JVT AVC\nCreation time: 5/04/2010 10:58:37 UTC\nModification time: 5/04/2010 10:58:37 UTC\nNumber of streams: 2\nType of stream nr. 1: audio (AAC Low complexity) {GPAC ISO Audio Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nVideo Codec: avc1\nResolution: 352 x 192\nDisplay aspect ratio: 341:192 = 1.776041 (~16:9)\nFramerate: 29.970029 fps\nBitrate: 131.527908 kbps\nAudio Codec: AAC Low complexity\nBitrate: 16.110460 kbps\nChannels: 1\nSample rate: 11025 Hz\n\nDownload whole package or just ones you want.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28042fd1ba1ab3281ec48a43ba16bd887eec1781","amp;dn":"Talk.Shows.Pack.2010.04.05%28Craig.Daily.Colbert%29.H264%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28042fd1ba1ab3281ec48a43ba16bd887eec1781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,4,47,209,186,26,179,40,30,196,138,67,186,22,189,136,126,236,23,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
