Tudor visitors remarked that it was grander than Hampton Court. \n\nBut the palace went missing until the 1950s, when a group of pupils at Northwood School in Hertfordshire discovered its remains beneath their school playing field. \n\nNow one of those schoolboys - Martin Biddle, who is now one of the country's most \ndistinguished archaeologists - joins Tony and the Team as they try to piece together the complete picture of this huge palace. \n\nIn its heyday, the Manor of More would have been an opulent playground fit for royalty and state visitors. Like Hampton Court, it was built as a place in which to entertain. Thomas More and Catherine of Aragon would have known it intimately. \n\nBut working out the layout of the palace is as tough a challenge as the Team have had for a long while. \n\nThere should be a huge front courtyard, but where is it? There should be a long gallery running off the back range, somewhere under the school's tennis courts. But it's equally elusive. \n\nBut, finally, enough pieces of this challenging Tudor jigsaw fall into place for the Team to visualise the splendour that once stood here, with its towered gatehouse rising majestically out of a wide moat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d098560cad08870f55429724fb953e6c47b276","amp;dn":"Time.Team.S20E10.Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d098560cad08870f55429724fb953e6c47b276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,208,152,86,12,173,8,135,15,85,66,151,36,251,149,62,108,71,178,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
