Whether itâ€™s information about a new sweetener or questions about one that has been on the market for years, interest in sweeteners and sweetness continues. Completely revised and updated, this fourth edition of Alternative Sweeteners provides information on new, recently evaluated, and numerous other alternatives to sucrose.\r\n\r\nThis edition retains the successful format that made previous editions so popular. The discussion of each sweetener includes production, physical characteristics, utility and relative sweetness compared to sucrose, technical qualities, admixture potential, application, availability, shelf life, general cost and economics, metabolism, carcinogenicity and other toxicity evaluation data, cariogenicity evaluations, and regulatory status.\r\n\r\nScientists and food technologists have been researching sweeteners and sweetness for more than 100 years. The number of approved sweeteners has increased substantially in the last three decades. Food product developers now have a number of sweeteners from which to choose in order to provide more product choices to meet the increasing demand for good-tasting products that have reduced calories. With contributions from experts who develop, make, and use the sweeteners, this book draws together the latest information into a convenient resource that can bring researchers closer to developing the ideal sweetener","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671a85b6acfd88c7eb15e6873a68d064a876d706","amp;dn":"Alternative+Sweeteners+4th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671a85b6acfd88c7eb15e6873a68d064a876d706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,26,133,182,172,253,136,199,235,21,230,135,58,104,208,100,168,118,215,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
