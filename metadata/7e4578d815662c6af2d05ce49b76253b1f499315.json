Although some of these may seem frivolous, even stupid, to other rival cultures, nevertheless they were and are the fundamental yardsticks of each of those particular cultures, nations and/or civilizations ÃƒÂ³ values they hold dear.\n\nHow were these primary values established? Again, going back into history we find such values were derived and molded through their particular religious beliefs. Whereas to White Europeans a cow is Just a cow, a useful animal that is not too bright, yet to Hindus a cow is a sacred object, a holy animal, due untold respect and veneration. Why is a cow holy to Hindus? Because their religion tells them so, and theirs is not to question why. To Moslems, Mecca and Medina are holy shrines because their religion tells them that's the way it is. To Jews, Moses, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and a whole passel of other Jewish scoundrels are their national and religious heroes. The Christians have their Jesus Christ, a mythical Jewish figure at best, with no meaningful historical evidence that such a figure ever even existed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e4578d815662c6af2d05ce49b76253b1f499315","amp;dn":"A+Revolution+of+Values+Through+Religion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e4578d815662c6af2d05ce49b76253b1f499315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,69,120,216,21,102,44,106,242,208,92,228,155,118,37,59,31,73,147,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
