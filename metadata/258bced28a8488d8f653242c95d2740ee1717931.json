This\nfour CD box set of unreleased tracks, alternate versions of well known\nsongs, and rare concert footage is a cornerstone of any Hendrix\ncollection. This box set is no place to start if you are not familiar with\nHendrix. I would recommend his first three studio albums for any type of\nHendrix indoctrination. This set, however, is a good place to complete\nyour collection or at least to explore his legacy a little deeper.\n\nEngineer Eddie Kramer was in charge of the project. He is a familiar\nfigure as his posthumous Hendrix production credits go back to The Cry\nOf Love in 1971. The tracks sound terrific as he re-mastered the sound\nwith modern equipment which gives the music a polished feel. He also\npresents the tracks in chronological order which is always welcome with\nprojects this extensive.Disc one finds three unreleased tracks. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTitle #3,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTaking Care Of Business,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHere He ComesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ may not be of the\nquality of HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first album but they certainly present his musical\nvision circa 1967. The gems of this first disc are alternate versions of\nsuch classics as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPurple Haze,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFoxey Lady,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThird Stone From\nThe SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which give a glimpse into the creative mind of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nDisc two presents some excellent live tracks. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is taken from a 1968\nconcert at Clark University in Massachusetts. It is a frenetic version that\nshows just how technically sound Hendrix was as a guitarist. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Wind\nCries Mary,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from a 1967 Paris concert, shows HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s softer side as\nhe provides subtle and melodic improvisations. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBurning The Midnight\nLampÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from September 5, 1967, is just Hendrix squeezing every possible\nsound from his guitar.\n\nDisc three is dominated by alternate versions. It is nice to hear ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHear My\nTrain A CominÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as a formative track as it was a concert staple. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpanish\nCastleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoom Full Of MirrorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ show subtle differences from the\nrecognized versions. Live versions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLittle WingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVoodoo ChildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\ncome complete with feedback and all sorts of distortion that only Hendrix\ncould produce on stage.\n\nDisc four is a feast of unreleased material. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCountry Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at over eight\nminutes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLover Man,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCherokee,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSlow BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ all make their\ndebuts. HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ early producer, Chas Chandler, did not approve of Alan\nDouglasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ changing HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s material and even taking writing credits\nduring the twenty years that he controlled HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s catalogue of music.\nWhen JimiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family won back control in a court battle, Chandler turned\nover a treasure trove of unreleased material to them. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn From The\nStormÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSlow BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ close out the set as they were recorded at the\nIsle Of Wight Music Festival, August 30, 1970, just prior to HendrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\ndeath.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience Box Set is a valuable addition to the\nHendrix legacy. Not only does it expand the music that Hendrix left\nbehind but it also solidifies him as a genius of the guitar who forever\nchanged the use of that instrument and rock music..\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n   1.
