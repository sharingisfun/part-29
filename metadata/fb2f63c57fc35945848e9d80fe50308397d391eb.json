I enjoy putting myself into the mindset of past times, it gives life to cultural history, plus the scratchy hollowness and distortion of old records creates a pleasing gothic effect. Together with old religious recordings ones for children are my favorite and I've wished for a CD just like this one for a long time. There's nothing I would change about this CD. The selection is excellent. The mood it creates is so effective that I first heard it on Halloween when someone used it to create atmosphere for trick-o-treaters! I would certainly reccomend it.\n&quot;\n\n192kbps\n\ntracklist:\n1. The Laughing Policeman - Grey\n2. The Prune Song - Crumit, Frank\n3. The Wedding of the Painted Doll - Brown\n4.
