John Renbourn is an absolute virtuoso and this is a showpiece. The playing is clean, crisp and faultless. The title track stands out in its simple beauty but the rest is almost equally addictive. The Medley and the English Dance feature some of the most accomplished classical/fingerpicking guitar you're likely to hear. \nRespect!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f88c749854af21075ef75fb612d72f5db554ac","amp;dn":"John+Renbourn...The+Black+Balloon%281979%29CD%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f88c749854af21075ef75fb612d72f5db554ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,248,140,116,152,84,175,33,7,94,247,95,182,18,215,47,93,181,84,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
