Something old but good and since Riot still lives homework should be done I will put up some of the best Riot albums at least in my opinion and yes I do know what an opinion is so to those that agree thank you, I do it for you. And for those opposed...Die like the rest. Now to the business at hand ......Fire Down Under is the third album by New York City heavy metal band Riot, released in 1981, and the last with original vocalist Guy Speranza. The song &quot;Flashbacks&quot; is dedicated to Neal Kay, the British DJ who supported heavy metal in the UK during the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.\n\nThe album was re-issued on CD in 1997 by the German-based High Vaultage label, utilizing a new, controversial remix by former Riot producer Steve Loeb, and in 1999 by Metal Blade Records in the U.S., this time featuring the original Elektra mix. Both versions contain various bonus tracks recorded for the original Capitol Records version of Fire Down Under which the band were unhappy with. Capitol dropped the band for being &quot;too heavy&quot; after hearing the final version subsequently released by Elektra Records.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Track listing\n        1.1 1997 CD edition bonus tracks\n        1.2 1999 CD edition bonus tracks\n    2 Personnel\n        2.1 Band members\n        2.2 Production\n    3 Cover versions and appearances\n    4 References\n\nTrack listing\n\nSide one\n\n    &quot;Swords and Tequila&quot; (Guy Speranza, Mark Reale) - 3:15\n    &quot;Fire Down Under&quot; (Speranza, Kip Leming) - 2:34\n    &quot;Feel the Same&quot; (Rick Ventura) - 4:30\n    &quot;Outlaw&quot; (Speranza, Reale) - 4:50\n    &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot; (Speranza, Reale, Leming, Ventura, Sandy Slavin) - 2:57\n\nSide two\n\n    &quot;Don't Hold Back&quot; (Speranza, Reale) - 3:15\n    &quot;Altar of the King&quot; (Speranza, Reale) - 4:46\n    &quot;No Lies&quot; (Ventura) - 4:10\n    &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; (Speranza, Reale) - 3:16\n    &quot;Flashbacks&quot; (Speranza, Reale, Leming, Ventura, Slavin) - 4:02\nPersonnel\nBand members\n\n    Guy Speranza - vocals\n    Mark Reale - guitar\n    Rick Ventura - guitar\n    Kip Leming - bass\n    Sandy Slavin - drums\n\nProduction\n\n    Steve Loeb, Billy Arnell - producers\n    Rod Hui - engineer, mixing\n    Howie Weinberg - mastering\n\nCover versions and appearances\n\n    The song &quot;Swords and Tequila&quot; is featured in the video game BrÃƒÂ¼tal Legend.\n\nSo there it is the first Riot album that I heard and it was all that was needed it became a staple in my Cassette Case (what is a cassette?) an ancient form of music storage see wiki for more. Anyway I will monitor the numbers and determine if I should continue this or you will insist that I do so or ect.  Seed if you like delete if you dont but do support your music I do this to try and keep good stuff alive and relevent and they call it a crime ......\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a913235f9fde90857b57ca346ece25f7fb21f3","amp;dn":"Riot+-+Fire+Down+Under++mp3++320k++1981","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a913235f9fde90857b57ca346ece25f7fb21f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,169,19,35,95,159,222,144,133,123,87,202,52,110,206,37,247,251,33,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
