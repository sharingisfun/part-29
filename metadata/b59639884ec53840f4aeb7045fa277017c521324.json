I searched for years to find this version 2.0, very hard to find.  This version installs on ANY machine, works perfect in 98, apparently also in Win 7 according to the screenshot I found.  I installed it in XP, works ok with a glitch now and then, but far better than nothing, I'm super happy I found this!\n\nEnjoy, and as always remember to seed!....:^)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b59639884ec53840f4aeb7045fa277017c521324","amp;dn":"Prody+Parrot+2.0+%28TextAssist-VoiceAssist%29+by+Mindmaker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b59639884ec53840f4aeb7045fa277017c521324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,150,57,136,78,197,56,64,244,174,183,4,95,162,119,1,124,82,19,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
