He is best known for ULYSSES (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's Odyssey are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominent among these the stream of consciousness technique he perfected.  Other major works are the short-story collection DUBLINERS (1914), and the novels A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN (1916) and FINNEGANS WAKE (1939).\n\n\nMultiple editions of all these works are included in a mix of PDF and/or ePUB formats as noted:\n\n* CHAMBER MUSIC (Jonathan Cape, 1972). -- ePUB\n\n* DUBLINERS (Oxford World's Classics, 2000).
