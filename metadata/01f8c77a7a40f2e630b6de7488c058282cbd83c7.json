Sprankle and Hubbard use a generic, non-language-specific approach to present the tools and concepts required when using any programming language to develop computer applications. Designed for students with little or no computer experience ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but useful to programmers at any level ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the text provides step-by-step progression and consistent in-depth coverage of topics, with detailed explanations and many illustrations.\nAbout the Author\n\nMaureen Sprankle is a Professor Emeritus at the College of the Redwoods, in Eureka, CA.
