He played lead guitar with Strawbs, The Overlanders, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, Elmer GantryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Velvet Opera, The Velvet Opera, Tintern Abbey, Fire, Roy Harper, Al Stewart, Lonnie Donegan, and switched to twelve string guitar in the 1970s. His first twelve string guitar suite, Earth Birth, was released on his own label, Phoenix Future and was produced by artist Ralph Steadman of Fear and Loathing fame. Critical acclaim led to Brett being signed on a four album deal with RCA Records. His K-tel Romantic Guitar album went platinum in the UK, but Brett stopped recording soon afterwards. He started recording again in 2000, with long time friend and fellow twelve string guitarist, John Joyce. Brett wrote for music magazines Melody Maker, Sound International and International Musician and continued working in the music industry in the later part of his career. He now writes a regular column for Acoustic, a magazine specializing in acoustic guitars. Is also the Associate Editor and Features Writer for Music Maker and Live in London magazines. He has appeared on BBC \n\n\n*1970 Paul Brett Sage:\nTying together many of the musical threads of their day, Paul Brett Sage was a progressive band in the best sense of the word, with an adventurous sound that was accessible to all, though they never lost sight of their origins. The group grew out of the folk duo of guitarist/singer Paul Brett and percussionist Bob Voice, and their eponymous debut album sees Paul Brett Sage retain a folksy bend, which reaches grand agit-folk heights on &quot;Trophies of War.&quot; Elsewhere, Brett's fiery licks and solos, particularly on the anthemic &quot;3D Mona Lisa,&quot; paints rock right across the backwoods vista. Evocative flamenco-tinged guitar sizzles around &quot;The Sun Died,&quot; while Brett's aggressive performance on both 12-string and electric guitar creates a &quot;Warlock&quot; worthy of the modern age. With the band's prominent use of percussion, Nicky Higginbottom's haunting flute, their strong melodies, and infectious choruses, Paul Brett Sage hovers between folk, rock, world, and pop; an album that deftly manages to be all things to all people.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 3D Mona Lisa\n02 The Sun Died\n03 Little Aztec Prince\n04 Reason For Your Asking\n05 Trophies Of War\n06 The Tower\n07 The Painter\n08 Mediterranean Lazy Heat Wave\n09 Warlock\nBonus Tracks\n10 Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\n11 One Night Stand\n\n\n*1971 Jubilation Foundry:\nNicky Higginbottom departed Paul Brett's Sage after the release of the band's eponymous debut album, and with her went the haunting flute that gave much of the album such a rich, pastoral sound. But the band was already moving in a new direction, exploring rock's roots and the genre's many permutations. Jubilation Foundry welds Sage's varied influences onto their sleeves, from &quot;Cottage Made for Two,&quot; an homage to the Everly Brothers, to the gospel fired &quot;Help Me Jesus&quot; and the Stax inspired &quot;Hold My Hand Mother.&quot; There are tributes to Southern blues and Southern rock, nods to singer/songwriters Cat Stevens and Harry Nilsson, and even a tip of the hat to the Beatles. With the group here sporting rich harmonies, the emphasis is on great songs in a variety of musical veins and moods, with singalong choruses, memorable melodies, and flashy musicianship evident throughout the album. \n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Cottage Made For Two\n02 Hold My Hand Mother\n03 Pasadena Days\n04 Keeper Of My Heart\n05 Goodbye Forever\n06 Good Old-Fashioned Funky Kind Of Music\n07 Bits\n08 I Fell So Far\n09 Written In Winter\n10 Tuesday Evening\n11 Help Me Jesus\n12 Jubilation Foundry\n13 Bits\nBonus Tracks\n14 Everlasting Butterfly\n15 Savannah Ladies\n16 To Everyman (Freedom)\n\n*1972 Schizophrenia:\nPaul Brett Sage's second full-length, Jubilation Foundry, was a rocking affair that danced delightfully from rock's roots in blues and R&amp;B to its many contemporary nooks and crannies. With their follow-up, 1972's Schizophrenia, PBS dove into the harder side of rock, quite a feat for a group that featured a plethora of percussion but no drummer; although one was brought in for the driving &quot;Slow Down Ma!.&quot; But as &quot;Custom Angel Man&quot; proved, Sage could rock like a Band of Gypsies even without one. However, it was Southern rockers and jam bands that were the group's strongest influences, and on &quot;Charlene&quot; they bring the two together. Imagine the Allmans fronting the Band to get the idea. The instrumental &quot;Limp Willie,&quot; in contrast, features great dueling acoustic guitars, until the song flops over into Grateful Dead territory. &quot;Take Me Back I Will Love You&quot; sounds just like Pink Floyd, minus all their pomposity and self-indulgence, and is one of the album highlights. And there's plenty more of those within, from the gorgeous harmonies and acoustic guitars that stream across &quot;Savior of the World&quot; and &quot;Tale of a Rainy Night&quot; to the bluesy show-stopper &quot;Make It Over.&quot; But as far afield as PBS seemed to have wandered from their folkie roots and for all their use of electric guitars, the many acoustic elements that initially defined their sound remain, giving the band and this set a sound entirely unlike anything else from the time. Routinely labeled acid folk and progressive rock, in fact, Sage were pop/rockers working in a thoroughly unique medium, creating a sound that still thrills today. \n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Custom Angel Man\n02 Charlene\n03 Song Of Life - Song Of Death\n04 Slow Down Ma!\n05 Saviour Of The World\n06 Limp Willie\n07 Tale Of A Rainy Night\n08 Take Me Back And I Will Love You\n09 Autumn\n10 Make It Over\n11 Bee\nBonus Track\n12 Dahlia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75fc7d3175add6b6c5f8f458a67b6c21cd6d6ba6","amp;dn":"Paul+Brett%27s+Sage+-+3+Albums+Japan+Mini+LP+CD+%282007%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75fc7d3175add6b6c5f8f458a67b6c21cd6d6ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,252,125,49,117,173,214,182,197,248,244,88,166,123,108,33,205,109,107,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
