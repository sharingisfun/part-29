Up the Junction&quot; was the third single released from Squeeze's second album, Cool for Cats. It is one of the band's most popular and well-remembered songs (especially in the UK), and reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nCool for Cats is the British new wave group Squeeze's second album, released in 1979. Cool for Cats contained more charting hit singles (four) than any other album the band has released.\n\nUp the Junction is a novel by Nell Dunn, first published in 1963. Lyricist Chris Difford said that the title phrase was lifted from the 1965 TV play version of the novel, directed by Ken Loach, and its subsequent 1968 movie remake. The film had a soundtrack by Manfred Mann, and a song by them, titled 'Up the Junction' Although the song is not derived, it includes several references to the drama.\n\nThis song is well known for its use of half-rhymes, such as &quot;ready&quot; and &quot;telly&quot; or &quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;missing&quot;.\n\nThe band made a tongue-in-cheek performance of the &quot;Up the Junction&quot; on British chart show Top of the Pops in which band members play the 'wrong instrument', with singer Glenn Tilbrook drumming and Jools Holland (normally pianist) making minimal attempts to look at all proficient at the guitar.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_the_Junction_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_the_Junction_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iACPdAadp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iACPdAadp&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video : MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6000kbps\n   Audio2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:09\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
