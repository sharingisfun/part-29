Notable events included the terrorism and internal affairs threat during the Enemies two-parter, and the arrival of another MCRT from Rota, Spain, the team that Tony was offered to be lead of in the beginning of season 3. The season ended on a five part story arc involving the Port-to-Port killer that menaced both teams. The finale airs on May 17th.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5db670be2a0ebc1520a445b750ddb55632a3e5","amp;dn":"NCIS+Season+8+Episodes+1-23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5db670be2a0ebc1520a445b750ddb55632a3e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,93,182,112,190,42,14,188,21,32,164,69,183,80,221,181,86,50,163,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
