It's become so ubiquitous, in fact, that it's lost any clear meaning. The only certainty these days is that it's bad to be a narcissistâ€”really badâ€”inspiring the same kind of roiling queasiness we feel when we hear the words sexist or racist. That's especially troubling news for millennials, the people born after 1980, who've been branded the &quot;most narcissistic generation ever.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7aca8a014bbb1fc5480b3a7519417d79df0a70","amp;dn":"Rethinking+Narcissism%3A+The+Bad-and+Surprising+Good-About","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7aca8a014bbb1fc5480b3a7519417d79df0a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,122,202,138,1,75,187,31,197,72,11,58,117,25,65,125,121,223,10,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
