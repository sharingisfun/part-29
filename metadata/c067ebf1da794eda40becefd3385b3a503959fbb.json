Although that was enough to get \nhim into the Montreal Canadiens, his frequent injuries cost him the confidence \nof his team and the fans. In the face of these doubts, Richard eventually shows \nthe kind of aggressive and skillful play that would make him one of the greatest \nplayers of all time as &quot;The Rocket.&quot; However for all his success, Richard and his \nfellow French Canadians face constant discrimination in a league dominated by \nthe English speaking. Although a man of few words, Richard begins to speak his \nown mind about the injustice which creates a organizational conflict that would \nculminate in his infamous 1955 season suspension that sparks an ethnic riot in \nprotest. In the face of these challenges, Richard must decide who \nexactly is he playing for.\n\n\n\nAvi Info\nFile Name ..........: The.Rocket.2005.DVDRip-Morsan.avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 733 671 424 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 716 476 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 699,68 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 621 356 483 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 606 793 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 592,57 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:56:35\nVideo Codec Code ...: XVID\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 710 KB/s\nResolution .........: 640 x 272\nAspect Ratio .......: 2.35:1\nTotal Frames .......: 174876 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 25 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 12 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0,163 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: No\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 112 304 725 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 109 673 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 107,10 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:56:35\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (VBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c067ebf1da794eda40becefd3385b3a503959fbb","amp;dn":"The.Rocket.2005.DVDRip-Morsan%28SweSub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c067ebf1da794eda40becefd3385b3a503959fbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,103,235,241,218,121,78,218,64,190,206,253,51,133,179,165,3,149,159,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
