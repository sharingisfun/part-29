He was all that and more. He was Alexander the Great.\n\nOliver StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alexander is based on the true story of one of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most luminous and influential leaders (COLIN FARRELL) -- a man who had conquered 90% of the known world by the age of 25. Alexander led his virtually invincible Greek, Macedonian, and later Eastern armies through 22,000 miles of sieges and conquests in just eight years, and by the time of his death at the age of 32, had forged an empire unlike any the world had ever seen. \n\nSet in AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pre-Christian world of social customs and morals far different from todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, the film explores a time of unmatched beauty and unbelievable brutality, of soaring ideals and staggering betrayals. The film takes a bold, honest look at AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and his relationships with his mother, Olympias (ANGELINA JOLIE), his father Philip (VAL KILMER), his lifelong friend and battle commander Hephaistion (JARED LETO), Roxane, his ambitious and beautiful wife (ROSARIO DAWSON), and his trusted general and confidant Ptolemy (ANTHONY HOPKINS). \n\nHis extraordinary journey begins when Alexander launches his invasion from Macedonia, first leading his armies to wrest Western Asia from Persian control, then driving his enormously outnumbered troops to an impossible victory over the mighty Persian army itself. Alexander expands his empire into the unknown lands of modern day Central Asia before venturing across the Hindu Kush, further than any Westerner had ever gone, continuing his conquests into the exotic world of India. Incredibly, and possibly unique in the annals of military history, Alexander was never defeated in battle. He relentlessly pushes his army across the sands, mountains and jungles of strange and mysterious lands, conquering every enemy who dares oppose him and weathering near-mutiny by his own men. \n\nThe film chronicles AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s path to becoming a living legend, from a youth fueled by dreams of myth, glory, and adventure, to his intense bonds with his closest companions, to his lonely and mysterious death as ruler of a vast Empire. Alexander is the incredible story of a life that united the known world and proved, if nothing else, fortune favors the bold. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f26b564f848183165172d9919cc8d065437857d","amp;dn":"Alexander+-+2004+%28incl+optional+dutch+subtitels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f26b564f848183165172d9919cc8d065437857d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,38,181,100,248,72,24,49,101,23,45,153,25,204,141,6,84,55,133,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
