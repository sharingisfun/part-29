It is the sequel to the critically-acclaimed 2007 video game Portal and was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Though initially slated for release in the last quarter of 2010, the game was postponed to the week of April 18, 2011. The game was released by Valve through Steam for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, while the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and retail Windows/OS X versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts. The game\\'s release on Steam was preceded by a second multi-week alternate reality game involving 13 independently-developed titles, culminating in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.\nPortal 2 comprises a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player\\'s character and simple objects using the \\&quot;portal gun\\&quot;, a device that can create inter-spatial portals between flat planes. Travelling through portals maintains an object\\'s speed, thus several puzzles require \\&quot;flinging\\&quot; the player-character or objects out one portal by gaining speed, such as by falling, before entering the other one. Other gameplay elements were added to Portal 2, including tractor beams, laser redirection, and special paint-like gels, taken from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint, that imparts special properties to objects it touches, such as increased momentum.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3373611c22e15c366f88e1a59feaa0b6e191d48f","amp;dn":"PORTAL+2+Portable+Multi-21+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3373611c22e15c366f88e1a59feaa0b6e191d48f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,115,97,28,34,225,92,54,111,136,225,165,159,234,160,182,225,145,212,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
