This is a flashback to the old style in terms of acting as well as cinematography. Some parts of it are quite goofy, but horror-comedy has lots of devotees. The pictorial composition is lovely, probably the best Dracula ever - somehow it seems better in B/W.\nGuy Madden got the Royal Winnipeg ballet to perform this one, it certainly raises the quality high above his other works, most likely he was inspired by The Overcoat (Panych).\n\n\n\n&quot;Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching&quot;-tedg.\n\nIn segmented mpg format, plays on VLC.\nRipped from tape, sorry aout the small picture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:132324d16a8cce0d2fa3731a8457fb40d921a3cd","amp;dn":"Dracula%2C+Pages+from+a+Virgin%27s+Diary+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"132324d16a8cce0d2fa3731a8457fb40d921a3cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,35,36,209,106,140,206,13,47,163,115,26,132,87,251,64,217,33,163,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
