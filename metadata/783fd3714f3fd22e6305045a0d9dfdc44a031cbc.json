This is the music I wrote for Anodyne (get it...here! or anodynegame.com, or soon, Steam!) ! Well, a lot of it, there's still some other junk sitting around on my hard drive or in &quot;The Cloud&quot;, but that isn't safe for public consumption (maybe...)\n\nSo, if you liked it at all and can, feel free to purchase the OST at, or just buy a single track! Spread the word, remix it (and let me know if you do, remixes are really cool).\n\nMaybe I'll upload FLAC later, but I'm probably too lazy.\n\n\nBye bye.\n\n-Sean Hogan (@seagaia2) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:783fd3714f3fd22e6305045a0d9dfdc44a031cbc","amp;dn":"Anodyne+Game+OST+%28Official%2C+vbr+.mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"783fd3714f3fd22e6305045a0d9dfdc44a031cbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,63,211,113,79,63,210,46,99,5,4,90,13,157,253,196,74,3,28,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
