A very cool name which was sadly tainted by tampon jokes. \n\nThe cover image was made from a mix of the free poster graphics handed out in the [WITH_TEETH] era and a conceptual image by Rob Sheridan during the album's Bleedthrough days.  \n\nThe music was taken off of domestic and imported [WITH_TEETH] albums as well as  two studio versions of songs from the NIN/JA promo CD.  Below is the track listing.\n\n01 . The Collector\n02 . The Line Begins To Blur\n03 . Not So Pretty Now\n04 . The Hand That Feeds (Ruff Mix)\n05 . You Know What You Are\n06 . With Teeth\n07 . Only\n08 . Sunspots\n09 . All The Love In The World\n10 . Love Is Not Enough\n11 . Non-Entity\n12 . Home\n13 . Beside You In Time\n14 . Right Where It Belongs\n\nAll tracks came from a 320KBPS CBR album rip but 3 and 11, which were from high quality MP3 VBRs.  The save in OGG Vorbis was due to MP3 Variable errors and a lack of wanting to mess with it anymore when a trial OGG run was successful.  \n\nI chose this track order for both audible and conceptual flow based on lyrical and song content.  The initial idea of dropping songs off of [WITH_TEETH] and putting in tracks from that era came from someone with the handle ZeroSum.  \n\nHere's to hoping after a few more passes through the whole album I don't become unhappy with the track list.  And to hoping nobody is disappointed with the line-up!\n\np.s. I dropped Every Day Is Exactly The Same as well as Getting Smaller.  GS was suggested.  EDIETS was my additional removal.  And substituting the Ruff Mix for the original was due to my not being very fond of the original but adoring the Ruff Mix.  \n\nBring on HESITATION MARKS!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a048e8d6b9208131b9a6778db12d6d7328d3414a","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Bleedthrough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a048e8d6b9208131b9a6778db12d6d7328d3414a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,72,232,214,185,32,129,49,185,166,119,141,177,45,109,115,40,211,65,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
