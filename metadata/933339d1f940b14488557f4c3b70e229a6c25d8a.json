The crew, however, finds their attempt to capture the perpetrators stalled by bureaucracy and their presence unwelcome. Desperate to gain the trust they need to accomplish their mission in just five days, the team enlists the aid of a Saudi Arabian police officer (Ashraf Barhoum), but as the agents infiltrate the dark and complex world of the Saudi crime scene, they find that the perpetrator's next target may be them. Directed by Peter Berg, The Kingdom also stars Jennifer Garner, Chris Cooper, and Jason Bateman. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 50 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933339d1f940b14488557f4c3b70e229a6c25d8a","amp;dn":"The+Kingdom%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933339d1f940b14488557f4c3b70e229a6c25d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,51,57,209,249,64,177,68,136,85,127,76,59,112,226,41,166,194,93,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
