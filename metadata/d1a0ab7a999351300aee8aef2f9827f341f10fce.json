As the focal point, Amphlett performed on stage wearing a school uniform and fishnet stockings, often using an illuminated neon tube as a prop and displaying aggression towards band members and the audience. The band, originally a five-piece, underwent numerous lineup changes with Amphlett and McEntee as the core members, before breaking up in 1996.\n\nIn May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named &quot;Science Fiction&quot; as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006 and in late 2007 Amphlett and McEntee reconvened to record a new single and begin working on a new album. The band played a short series of live gigs in Australia in late 2007 and early 2008.\n\nDivinyls have released five studio albums, with four of them reaching the Top 10 in Australia and one, &quot;Divinyls&quot;, reaching No. 15 in the US. Their biggest-selling single, &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; (1991) achieved No. 1 in Australia, No. 4 in the US and No. 10 in the UK\t\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n&quot;Boys in Town&quot; - 2:50\n&quot;Science Fiction&quot; - 3:32\n&quot;Siren (Never Let You Go)&quot; - 2:28\n&quot;Only Lonely&quot; - 3:15\n&quot;Casual Encounter&quot; - 3:05\n&quot;Good Die Young&quot; - 3:36\n&quot;In My Life&quot; - 3:43\n&quot;Pleasure and Pain&quot; - 3:55\n&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; - 3:38\n&quot;Temperamental&quot; - 4:30\n&quot;Back to the Wall&quot; - 4:38\n&quot;Hey Little Boy&quot; - 3:21\n&quot;Punxsie&quot; - 4:16\n&quot;I Touch Myself&quot; - 3:46\n&quot;Love School&quot; - 5:23\n&quot;Make Out Alright&quot; - 4:38\n&quot;I'm On Your Side&quot; - 4:16\n&quot;I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore&quot; - 4:30\n&quot;I'm Jealous&quot; - 4:16\n&quot;Human On the Inside&quot; - 4:12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1a0ab7a999351300aee8aef2f9827f341f10fce","amp;dn":"Divinyls+-+Greatest+Hits+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1a0ab7a999351300aee8aef2f9827f341f10fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,160,171,122,153,147,81,48,10,238,138,239,47,152,39,243,65,241,15,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
