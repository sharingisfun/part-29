(stonerrock),\n\nSlights and Abuse is 28 minutes long?a full-length by many bands? standards?but it?s really only half an album. A companion LP, Sycophant, is due out in February, and Seventh Rule plans to release both on a single CD around the same time. Sycophant will invert the theme of Slights to focus on serving oneself instead of a larger social organism, echoing ideas from Nietzche and LaVey that many a metalhead has found inspirational.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:179ceaf3cb152059010c557e4b6f62b2407706dc","amp;dn":"Indian+-+Slights+%26+Abuse+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"179ceaf3cb152059010c557e4b6f62b2407706dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,156,234,243,203,21,32,89,1,12,85,126,75,111,98,178,64,119,6,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
