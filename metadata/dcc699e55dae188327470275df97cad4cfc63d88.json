Many people feel that Mixing in the Analog domain imparts an elusive quality, a greater sense of weight, space, dynamics with a more Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthree dimensionalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ image.\nThe sounds of Analog devices is potentially complex. The initial signal is changed in many, often very subtle ways, distortion characteristics, frequency response deviations, nonlinear saturation for instance.\nVolterra technology captures these nonlinear characteristics inherent in the original hardware.\n\n\nSampling process has been performed by Tim Petherick. The unit was sampled with Mastering quality Convertors, using a method which takes considerably more time than the normal sampling standard. This method is of benefit to the entire audio spectrum.\nHigh and Low shelves were sampled together, cutting down on the amount of times the sample tone traveled through the hardware and convertor circuits. This benefits the sonic accuracy and overall shape of the curves.\nFour sample rates are provided, this avoids any negative SRC artifacts when matching with project sample rates, and helps project loading times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Controls\n\nLow and High Frequency Shelves: engaged together by Ã¢â‚¬ËœShelvingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ switch at the right of the Silk Eq.\nLow Shelf with fixed frequency at 40 Hz. Gain range is approx. Ã‚Â±15dB.\nHigh Shelf with fixed frequency at 15 kHz. Gain range is approx.

Interestingly the Low Shelf Eq curves are of different shape whether in boost or cut, this is faithfully reproduced from the original unit.\n\nHigh ShelfShelf: High Frequency Shelf fixed at 15 kHz with Ã‚Â±15dB of adjustable gain.\nJust how the low shelves are faithfully reproduced from the original unit, the high Shelf Eq curves are also differently shaped whether in boost or cut.\n\nMid Bell: On the original Hardware called Ã¢â‚¬ËœPresenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Sys Requirements\n\nWindows Minumum\n\nXp Sp2\nRam 2 Gb\nHd 120 Gb\nScreen Resolution 1024x768\nAudio Host VST compatible\nCPU Dual Core\n\nWindows Recommended\n\nLatest 64 bits version\n\nRam 24 Gb\nHd 120 Gb SSD\nScreen Resolution Full Hd\nAudio Host VST compatible\nLatest multicore CPU\n\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\n  UnRaR\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Run our keygen.\n4.Select a product.\n5.Click GENERATE to generate *.AUT file.\n6.Save *.AUT to the same location to the plugin.\n\n\nOur Keygen gets Challenge Code automatically from your computer.\nHowever, you can get that code manually.\nChallenge Codes are identical for all plugins.\n(You don't need to load *.SER file one by one).\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Run the plugin.\n *.SER (Challenge Code File) will be generated.\n4.Run our keygen.\n5.Select a product.\n6.Click &quot;Get From File&quot; and open that *.SER file.\n7.Click GENERATE to generate *.AUT file.\n8.Save *.AUT to the same location to the plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
