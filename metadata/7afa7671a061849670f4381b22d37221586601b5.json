An epic 1970s tale about a group of rebel rock bands who rose up from one of the most unpopular, marginalised parts of the USA - the Deep South - and conquered the world.\n\nThe Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and others that followed did this entirely on their own terms, blending the music of the region - blues, country, rock and roll - with a gung-ho attitude that set the South, and then America, on fire.\n\nTheir diverse styles, from juke joint boogie and country-rock honks to cosmic blues blasts, had a huge cultural and political impact, even helping to elect Jimmy Carter as president in 1976.\n\nTheir extraordinary adventure is brought to life through vivid period archive and contributions from the survivors of those crazy times, including Gregg Allman, REM's Mike Mills, Doug Gray, Al Kooper, Bonnie Bramlett, Charlie Daniels and other key figures in the movement.\n\nFirst broadcast on BBC Four, 13/4/12.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afa7671a061849670f4381b22d37221586601b5","amp;dn":"The+Saga+of+Southern+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afa7671a061849670f4381b22d37221586601b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,250,118,113,160,97,132,150,112,244,56,27,34,211,114,33,88,102,1,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
