Indeed, it remains something of a mystery that an artist whose work constantly refers to the narrow milieu of his childhood, the now vanished world of eastern European Jewry, should have achieved such extraordinary popularity. \r\n\r\nOne major reason must surely be the way in which Chagall's art is unashamedly rooted in the particular, yet succeeds in transcending the particular to strike emotional and spiritual chords of universal relevance.\r\n\r\nVirtually alone among the major twentieth-century artists, he concerns himself with both tragedy and joy; his most characteristic work possesses a joie de vivre, a playful wit and sense of the fantastical rarely found in the art of any period. Also unusual is the unabashed celebration of romantic love to be found in so much of his work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45b24f824abbc5dd05ae8586df3ae5f05d60a49a","amp;dn":"Chagall+%28Phaidon+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45b24f824abbc5dd05ae8586df3ae5f05d60a49a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,178,79,130,74,187,197,221,5,174,133,134,223,58,229,240,93,96,164,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
