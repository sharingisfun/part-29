Hope someone likes it.  \n\nI was unable to find any other collection of just Watkins Glen soundboards (Friday, July 27-28, 1973) and figured I'd convert some of the source files from the differenent sets from each day on more obscure sites into MP3s.  \n\nThe Friday set (the Mother of All Soundchecks) has had great reviews. The Saturday set is also good, and includes three songs as encores with the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers and The Band all on stage together.\n\nNote: This set of files was converted from the lossless FLAC format found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=533988&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=533988&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe bt.etree.org community is a bit torrent site for sharing of lossless files of open artists, is certainly worth checking out.\n\nAll source documents that trace the conversion of the various files are included. Some started out as soundboard files, some as FM radio broadcasts, etc...but all were in FLAC when I found them. Artwork and other data is not my work, but creditis included.\n\n====== Watkins Glen Summerjam Festival - 1973 (Day 1 of 2) =====\n\nGrateful Dead\nGrand Prix Racecourse Watkins Glen, NY\nJuly 27, 1973 (Soundcheck)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Jam_at_Watkins_Glen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Jam_at_Watkins_Glen&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJerry Garcia - Lead Guitar, Vocals\nDonna Jean Godchaux - Vocals\nKeith Godchaux - Keyboards\nBill Kreutzmann - Drums\nPhil Lesh - Electric Bass, Vocals\nBob Weir - Rhythm Guitar, Vocals\n\n===== Summary ======\n\nI changed the naming convention of the converted files to be more MP3 player friendly:\n\nSet I\n-----\n01 - The Promised Land\n02 - Sugaree*\n03 - Mexicali Blues*\n04 - Bird Song\n05 - Big River\n06 - Tennessee Jed\n07 - Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\n\nSet II\n-----\n08 - Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo\n09 - Me And My Uncle\n10 - Soundcheck Jam -&gt; \n11 - Wharf Rat\n12 - Around And Around\n\n====== Watkins Glen Summerjam Festival - 1973 (Day 2 of 2) =====\n\n\n--Set III--  \n\n01 - Bill Graham Intro     (Audience Master Cassette&gt;?&gt;C&gt;DAT&gt;CDR&gt;SHN)\n02 - Bertha\n03 - Beat It on Down the Line\n04 - Brown Eyed Women\n05 - Mexicali Blues\n06 - Box Of Rain\n07 - Here Comes Sunshine   (FM&gt;Cassette x5&gt;DAT&gt;CDR&gt;SHN)\n08 - Looks Like Rain       (FM&gt;Cassette x5&gt;DAT&gt;CDR&gt;SHN)\n09 - Row Jimmy             (Audience Master Cassette&gt;Reel&gt;DAT&gt;CDR&gt;SHN)\n10 - Jack Straw            (Same as above)\n11 - Deal\n12 - Playing in the Band\n\n--Set IV --\n\n13 - Around &amp; Around       (Audience Master Cassette&gt;?&gt;Cassette&gt;DAT&gt;CDR&gt;SHN)\n14 - Loose Lucy\n15 - Big River\n16 - He's Gone -&gt;\n17 - Truckin'-&gt; Nobody's Fault Jam -&gt;\n18 - El Paso\n19 - China Cat Sunflower -&gt;I Know You Rider\n20 - Sella Blue\n21 - Eyes of the World -&gt;\n22 - Sugar Magnolia\n\n--Encore ONE--\n\n23 - Sing Me Back Home      (Audience Master Cassette&gt;Cassette&gt;DAT&gt;CDR&gt;SHN)\n\n--Encore Two--with the Allman Brothers Band &amp; the Band\n\n24 - Not Fade Away          (Audience Master Cassette&gt;?&gt; Cassette&gt;DAT&gt;CDR&gt;SHN)\n25 - Mountain Jam           (Soundboard Master Reel&gt;?&gt;Cassette&gt;DAT&gt;CDR&gt;SHN)\n26 - Johnny B.
