Two guitars and a mandolin bring the rustic backwoods to their sound and they sure can pick when they open the throttle as on the appropriately named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boil OverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Wanter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But the band is smart enough to realize that speedy fingers are only a means to an end and all the high octane fret burning doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t amount to much without top shelf songs. They have written a batch of them here, of which the moody Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ finds the swamp rock lurking under the surface and the lovely and lively Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mountain AnnieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ flows like a burbling country brook. The latter features a chorus perfect for audience sing-alongs as the melody soars, riding on an effortless interplay between acoustic guitar and mandolin.\n\nThis is Americana of the highest order, driven by charming three-part harmonies that never feel forced. Mimi Naja, who contributes piano along with her sprightly mandolin, also shines as a tough, husky voiced lead vocalist, a role she inhabits all too seldom on these eleven tunes. She sings and plays keys on the sweet Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhippoorwillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the closing Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Get Back Home,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a beautifully moving ballad that brings drama to this wonderful set, and like the best albums, leaves us wanting more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8249ff9a27f6ac52081ed9a2310eb5cde6c8591f","amp;dn":"Fruition+-+Just+One+Of+Them+Nights+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8249ff9a27f6ac52081ed9a2310eb5cde6c8591f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,73,255,154,39,246,172,82,8,30,217,162,49,14,181,205,230,200,89,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
