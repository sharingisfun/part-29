Music producer and engineer Clement &quot;Sir Coxon&quot; Dodd experimented with rhythyms of American R&amp;B and jazz coupled with his own preference for a strong bassline made him a force in the Jamaican music industry. Various hits from this compact disc are easy to listen to and enjoyable to dance in step with. Most of today&amp;#039;s lyrics are a rework of the original hits and some a distortion of the Studio One legacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb41f6b73a059be4435bff7b0f9aa4195806a985","amp;dn":"Mojo+Rock+Steady","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb41f6b73a059be4435bff7b0f9aa4195806a985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,65,246,183,58,5,155,228,67,91,255,123,15,154,164,25,88,6,169,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
