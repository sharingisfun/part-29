Untitled (3:14)\n\n\nOn Recovery, his seventh major label studio album, Eminem has reached out to an exciting list of first-time collaborators, including DJ Khalil, Just Blaze, Jim Jonsin and Boi-1da, among others.\n\nEMINEM releases Recovery just over a year after his last album, 2009's Relapse. Relapse put the cap on an impressive ten years of recorded output, and contributed to Eminem being the biggest selling artist of 2000-2009. In recognition of this, Neilsen SoundScan named him their Artist of the Decade. Relapse entered the charts at #1 and, at nearly double platinum, was the best selling rap album of last year. It also earned Eminem his 11th Grammy award, winning in the Best Rap Album category. Relapse's first single, &quot;Crack A Bottle&quot; from Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, soared to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (Eminem's second #1 after 2002's &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;) and set a SoundScan record at the time of its release for opening week download sales (418,000). The album also spun off two other hits; the Top 10 &quot;We Made You&quot; and Top 20 &quot;Beautiful.&quot;\n\n&quot;I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year,&quot; remarked EMINEM. &quot;But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e30497a8b60775fba4731a65ab00eb2c498a1b5","amp;dn":"Eminem+-+Recovery+%282010%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e30497a8b60775fba4731a65ab00eb2c498a1b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,48,73,122,139,96,119,95,186,71,49,166,90,176,14,178,196,152,161,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
