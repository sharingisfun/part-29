Thomas Wayne Perkins, 22 July 1940, Battsville, Mississippi, USA, d. 15 August 1971, Tennessee, USA. Wayne was a classic one-hit artist, the younger brother of Luther Perkins, the guitarist who developed and first played the trademark two-string guitar style behind Johnny Cash. Wayne attended Humes High School in Memphis, where a few years earlier the young Elvis Presley had come and gone with little fanfare. There Wayne formed a group called the De-Lons, which was recorded by Scotty Moore, guitarist for Presley, for the Fernwood Records label, which Moore co-owned. That first single did nothing, but WayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second single for Fernwood, a weepy ballad titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœTragedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, made it to number 5 in the US national chart. The song had renewed life in 1961 as a hit for the Fleetwoods. Wayne recorded for other labels but was unable to follow that hit, although Presley recorded a song he had written, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Girl Next Door Went A WalkingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, in 1960. Wayne eventually moved into production work, but his life was tragically cut short when he was killed in a car collision near Memphis in 1971.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3eb4487253c9ae27c874ed879a6f31eba451975","amp;dn":"Thomas+Wayne+%26ndash%3B+Vinyl+Vic+Presents+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3eb4487253c9ae27c874ed879a6f31eba451975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,235,68,135,37,60,154,226,124,135,78,216,121,166,243,30,186,69,25,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
