Crowned with the Crystal of Destiny, this relic brought good luck to his grandfather until it was stolen by pirates and broken into pieces. Now these pieces rest in different parts of the world. Your mission is to help Kenny find all the pieces and restore the family relic. Upon the game launch, players will immerse themselves into wonderful underwater locals with exotic ocean flora, corals, and ruins of an ancient city in the background. These vibrant, cartoon-like visuals will accompany you all the way through sixty game levels in three diverse worlds of the games adventure. Along the way, you must collect different coins, gold, diamonds, and artifacts. The latter will be your key to the next level. Once you have collected all artifacts, the bathyscaphe will take you and Kenny to the next level. For all this seeming simplicity, the game may be a challenge at times. You will meet different ocean creatures like hermit crabs, sea urchins, and octopuses. Guide Kenny with caution because their sharp spines and strong tentacles can hurt him. In places where it's impossible to walk, Kenny can swim. Jumping on a white jellyfish or on floating bubbles, Kenny can move up and reach for high places.\n\nFeatures :\n\n-&gt; Over 60 levels in 3 unique worlds\n-&gt; Outstanding detailed graphics and special effects\n-&gt; Thrilling view of underwater worlds full of the lost treasures and enemy creatures\n-&gt; Addictive adventure gameplay\n-&gt; Amazing soundtrack\n-&gt; DivoRating system allowing players to share high-scores all over the world\n\nSystem Requirements :\n\n-&gt; OS: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista\n-&gt; RAM: 64Mb\n-&gt; CPU: 400MHz\n-&gt; Video card with 16Mb RAM\n-&gt; DirectX 8.1 or higher\n\nScreenshots :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myplaycity.com/gn/screen_640x480/190_screen_3_640x480.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myplaycity.com/gn/screen_640x480/190_screen_3_640x480.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myplaycity.com/gn/screen_640x480/190_screen_1_640x480.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myplaycity.com/gn/screen_640x480/190_screen_1_640x480.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myplaycity.com/gn/screen_640x480/190_screen_2_640x480.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myplaycity.com/gn/screen_640x480/190_screen_2_640x480.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease Seed and leave a Comment....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a51102b4d6f6fd2a2c1a8c6fb7399a8135898c65","amp;dn":"Subsea+Relic+-+Adventure+Game+%7Bkrzzy%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a51102b4d6f6fd2a2c1a8c6fb7399a8135898c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,17,2,180,214,246,253,42,44,26,140,111,183,57,154,129,53,137,140,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
