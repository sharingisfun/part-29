Peter Eisner reveals how Pius XI intended to unequivocally reject Nazism in one of the most unprecedented and progressive pronouncements ever issued by the Vatican, and how a group of conservative churchmen plotted to prevent it. \nFor years, only parts of this story have been known. Eisner offers a new interpretation of this historic event and the powerful figures at its center in an essential work that provides thoughtful insight and raises controversial questions impacting our own time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc5102348e2ca62358d5d859825331dfbfc3781","amp;dn":"The+Pope%27s+Last+Crusade+by+Peter+Eisner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc5102348e2ca62358d5d859825331dfbfc3781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,197,16,35,72,226,202,98,53,141,93,133,152,37,51,29,251,252,55,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
