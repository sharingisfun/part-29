(This was done in metaphor showing teenagers as disgusting fast-food consuming zombies.) There were many double meanings indicating the song&amp;#039;s true meaning, including a magazine that Lauper is staring at titled &quot;Beefcake&quot; and other sexual meanings such as the &quot;self-service&quot; sign and three gas pumps with the signs Good, Better and Nirvana in the cartoon part of the video, the vibrating motorcycle, the &quot;masterbingo&quot; part of the video with &quot;Uncle Siggy&quot; Sigmund Freud as host, and Lauper wearing blackout glasses with a white cane in several scenes of the video. In fact, the video doesn&amp;#039;t go as far as the lyrics, as the magazine referenced in the song (&quot;...in the pages of a Blueboy magazine&quot;) was a popular gay erotica magazine of the time, whereas the magazine Lauper holds represents the tamer?and somewhat closeted?erotica of an earlier era. \n\nTo date, &amp;#039;She Bop&amp;#039; is Lauper&amp;#039;s third-highest charting and third-most commercially successful single worldwide, after Girls Just Want to Have Fun and Time After Time. It charted in the Top 50 in 16 countries (going Top 10 in 12 of them), including: #3 in the U.S. and #6 in Australia and New Zealand. \n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b358e8476b5c3624a041897a1e2772189c4303ef","amp;dn":"Cyndi+Lauper+-+She+Bop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b358e8476b5c3624a041897a1e2772189c4303ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,88,232,71,107,92,54,36,160,65,137,122,30,39,114,24,156,67,3,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
