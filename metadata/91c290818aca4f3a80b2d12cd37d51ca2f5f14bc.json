They were told to take it anyway they could, with machine guns, flame-throwers, entrenching tools, their bare hands. They were used to war, to blood, death, the vilest savagery that man could devise. But the O.G.P.U. Prison was something different - a hell they hadn't met before, a bastion, an inferno that rained blood and butchery on Porta, the Legionnaire, Tiny, Barcelona, the men of the Panzer battalion who no longer had tanks, only a creeping barrage of death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91c290818aca4f3a80b2d12cd37d51ca2f5f14bc","amp;dn":"OGPU+Prison+-+Hassel+Sven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91c290818aca4f3a80b2d12cd37d51ca2f5f14bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,194,144,129,138,202,79,58,128,178,209,44,211,125,81,202,47,95,20,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
