It was their 5th studio release. Paul Rodgers revealed on In the Studio with Redbeard (which devoted an episode to Desolation Angels) that the album's title came from the novel of the same name by Jack Kerouac.\n\nDesolation Angels was recorded at Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey, England in late 1978.\n\nIt is considered the last strong album by Bad Company, mostly because it contains their last major hit, &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy,&quot; written by Paul Rodgers which its inspiration came from a guitar synthesizer riff that Rodgers came up with.\n\n&quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot;, written by bassist Boz Burrell, also received substantial airplay on rock stations. It was the first of only three songs he ever wrote for the band, but is widely revered as one of the band's finest compositions.\n\nThe album reached #3 on the Billboard album charts in 1979 and went Platinum in 1979 and Double Platinum subsequently.\n\nBad Company is an English rock supergroup founded in 1973 by two former Free band members, singer Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke as well as Mott the Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and King Crimson bassist Boz Burrell. Peter Grant, who managed British rock band Led Zeppelin, agreed to manage the band (he managed Bad Company until 1982, when Swan Song Records folded). Bad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 1970s. Many of their singles, such as &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot;, and &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;, remain popular with rockers of both the past and present, and their hits remain staples of classic rock radio.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;zdf.kulter&quot; logo at the top left)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desolation_Angels_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desolation_Angels_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LANaaaAEo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LANaaaAEo&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:16\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
