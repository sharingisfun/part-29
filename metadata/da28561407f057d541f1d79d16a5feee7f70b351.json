The song was questioning if love is enough or not. Eddie stated he heard the ballad as a &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; type of song, and played like his guitar hero, Eric Clapton, even using a Leslie rotating speaker like Clapton did on the tune by The Beatles. Alex also appears behind the mic with Eddie and Anthony in the music video, so it seems that he is singing background vocals with them, despite not singing on the track. Returning musician Steve Lukather was the one to sing backing vocals on this song, just as he did for the band earlier on their album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge on &quot;Top of the World&quot;.\n\n\n\nFile Name:\n12 Not Enough - Van Halen\nchin\nFile Format:\nmp4\n\nDuration:\n00:05:11\n\nBit Rate:\n1344k\n\nFile Size:\n49.99 MB\n\nVideo Codec:\nh264\n\nVideo Bitrate:\n1214k\n\nVideo Size:\n720x528\n\nAspect Ratio:\n1.36:1\n\nFrame Rate:\n23.98fps\n\nAudio Codec:\nmp3\n\nAudio Bitrate:\n128k\n\nChannels:\n2\n\nSample Rate:\n48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da28561407f057d541f1d79d16a5feee7f70b351","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Not+Enough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da28561407f057d541f1d79d16a5feee7f70b351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,40,86,20,7,240,87,213,65,241,215,157,22,165,254,238,127,112,179,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
