Since Chaucer has become an unassailable icon of print culture, and hip-hop is an unassailable icon of contemporary digital cool, he saw this radical new fusion of content and style as the perfect medium to deliver ChaucerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s astonishingly timeless message to a younger generation growing indifferent to the delights of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œarchaicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ literary forms.\n\nThis fusion has produced, with both texts reproduced here on facing pages, one of the most exciting and extraordinarily fertile literary documents of our age.\n\nThe raps are presented hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½along with ChaucerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original Middle English, BrinkmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s explanatory introductions, and his brother and stage manager ErikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s illustrationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as the best possible way of telling the story of how these stories came about, and what they were meant to do.\n\nA hugely successful hit at the Edinburgh Festival, Brinkman has worked with the London and Cambridge school systems, rekindling an interest among both performance-poetry fans and students in the work of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe father of the English language.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdfee064a9831687765dd769fef455d3b0030a93","amp;dn":"The+Rap+Canterbury+Tales+-+Baba+Brinkman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdfee064a9831687765dd769fef455d3b0030a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,254,224,100,169,131,22,135,118,93,215,105,254,244,85,211,176,3,10,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
