Superior to the decadent West, Stalin&amp;#039;s Soviet Union is a haven \n\nfor its citizens, providing for all of their needs: education, health care, security. In exchange, all that is \n\nrequired is their hard work, and their loyalty and faith to the Soviet State.\n\nLeo Demidov knows this better than most. A rising, prominent officer in the State Security force, Leo is a former \n\nwar hero whose only ambition is to serve his country. To defend this workers&amp;#039; paradise - and to guarantee a secure \n\nlife for his parents and for his wife, Raisa - Leo has spent his career guarding against threats to the State. \n\nIdeological crimes - crimes of thought, crimes of disloyalty, crimes against the revolution - are forcefully \n\nsuppressed, without question.\n\nAnd then the impossible happens. A different kind of criminal - a murderer - is on the loose, killing at will. At \n\nthe same time, Leo finds himself demoted and denounced by his enemies, all but sentenced to death. The only way to \n\nsalvage what remains of his life is to uncover this criminal. But in a society that is officially paradise, it&amp;#039;s a \n\ncrime against the state to suggest that a murderer - much less a serial killer - is in their midst.\n\nTo save his life and the lives of his family, Leo must confront the vast resources and reach of the security \n\nforces, with only Raisa remaining at his side, to find and stop a criminal that the State won&amp;#039;t even admit exists.\n\n\n\n             ****************************************************\n\n\n\nIf you like audio books please buy some.
