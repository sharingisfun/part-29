Padraig Nally testified that he lived in fear of the victim and attacked John Ward while\nhe trespassed on the farmer's property.\nAnn Costello, a community worker with the Galway Traveller Movement, was interviewed by the Sunday Business Post after Nally's second acquittal. She said,\n''Travellers are very concerned about this verdict and feel powerless. Political leadership has been absent on this issue, and it is time Travellers got reassurance\n- at senior government level - that they will be afforded the same protection as every other citizen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n* (Padraig Nally was freed in 2006 after the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that Mr Justice Paul Carney, the high court judge in the original trial, erred in law by failing to allow\nthe jury the opportunity to return a verdict of not guilty).\n\n\nFile info:\nComplete name                            : PÃƒÂ¡draic Nally [RTE Ireland] HDTV 720p x264 AC3 DeViL303.mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFile size                                : 927 MiB\nDuration                                 : 51mn 55s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 497 Kbps\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2013-02-22 02:12:52\nWriting application                      : mkvmerge v2.5.3 ('Boogie') built on Mar  7 2009 15:00:41\nWriting library                          : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;074f6e606f474b332937&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 3 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 51mn 55s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 303 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 20.0 Mbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.100\nStream size                              : 838 MiB (90%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 93 r1542M 5b86182\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=4 / deblock=1:-1:-1 / \nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : A_AC3\nDuration                                 : 51mn 55s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 71.3 MiB (8%)\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\n\nIf your looking for more irish stuff check out sharingirish or my other torrents on TPB, stay away from the other private irish site previously known as CT, its run by a right muppet who renames other peoples files to put them into his pay only VIP section and never credits the original cappers, most of the stuff on his site is either sourced elsewhere from sites like sharingirish or ripped from RTE player in the lowest quality! I should know, i used to moderate there until i realised what was going on, so stay away from there and help keep irish torrents FREE forever! :D\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd84cff68878eb3aa9dc02245c8cd8fe0529b1f","amp;dn":"Padraic+Nally+%5BRTE+Ireland%5D+HDTV+720p+x264+AC3+DeViL303","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd84cff68878eb3aa9dc02245c8cd8fe0529b1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,216,76,255,104,135,142,179,170,157,192,34,69,200,205,143,224,82,155,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
