Everything thing Homma-sensei says is translated in Czech and though he is supposed to be talking in English, I didn't understand a word (even the translator had difficulties and sometimes Homma-sensei's assistant had to intervene.  I guess they couldn't find a Japanese translator).  But don't worry, you'll understand what he does if you're already an aikidoka.  If you're not, download one of the introductory videos, go practice in an Aikido dojo a couple of months (this is NOT optional) and come back.\n\nThe video itself contains primarily jo kata and kaeshi waza (techniques you can use in response to incorrectly applied techniques).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e19250b29e24be532dda0a9a20f49777965d38","amp;dn":"Aikido+-+Gaku+Homma+-+Ostrava+Seminary+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e19250b29e24be532dda0a9a20f49777965d38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,225,146,80,178,158,36,190,83,45,218,10,154,32,244,151,119,150,93,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
