You're probably not going to want to find this import unless you're a big swamp pop fan. James is a decent guitarist, and an okay singer, although very derivative of Tony Joe White. Much of the material here is only passable, however, despite some solid grooves like the title track, and hot insrumentals like &quot;That's Right&quot; and &quot;No Yo.&quot; As '60s swamp pop goes, though, it has its cool moments, and even some of the filler is nicely atmospheric.\n\n/Allmusic\n\n\n\n- Don't trust the hippies at Allmusicguide.com, the recordings on this disc are groovy and funky as hell:-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f54f2c242e8b9d5805f3b5fcbc1c72bad8d600b2","amp;dn":"Danny+James+-+Boogie+In+The+Mud%2C+Southern+Swamp+Guitar+%28MP3%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f54f2c242e8b9d5805f3b5fcbc1c72bad8d600b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,79,44,36,46,139,157,88,5,243,181,252,188,28,114,186,216,214,0,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
