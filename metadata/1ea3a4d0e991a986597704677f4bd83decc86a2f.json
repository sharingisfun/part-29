Sunder's childhood friend Prem,    \n a seasoned conman who operates in Bombay,     \n convinces the gullible Sunder to mortgage     \n his land to the village Zamindar (landlord)   \n and fly to Dubai. Prem promises Sunder a      \n handsomely paying teacher's job in Dubai      \n that would give Sunder enough money to start  \n his school within two years. Sunder does as   \n told and arrives in Bombay to meet Prem; not  \n only is there no sign of his friend at the    \n station, but Sunder also gets unwittingly     \n involved with a petty thief who robs him of   \n all his luggage and money. To make matters    \n worse, when Sunder reaches Prem's lodge,      \n he finds an apologetic letter from Prem       \n informing him that he has used his Rs.10,000  \n to get himself to Dubai instead and will      \n one day repay him...                          \n                                               \n IMDB Link:                                    \n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126234/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126234/&lt;/a&gt;  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yxyrm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yxyrm.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CVicO.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CVicO.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IxnGS.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IxnGS.png&lt;/a&gt;   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea3a4d0e991a986597704677f4bd83decc86a2f","amp;dn":"Chamatkar.%281992%29.DVDRiP.x264.AC3.Chapters.Esubs.%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea3a4d0e991a986597704677f4bd83decc86a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,163,164,208,233,145,169,134,89,119,4,103,127,75,216,61,236,200,106,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
