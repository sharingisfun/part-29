The acting by Kenneth Branagh and Stanley Tucci is unbelievably good, and this movie is based on actual events. Sadly, this is one of those extremely good movies that, for whatever reason, never made it to blu-ray, so there are no HD sources that I'm aware of, which is why this is in 576p resolution. Nevertheless, I encoded this with the same bitrate that I normally use for HD sources, so the quality is about as good as it can possibly be. This movie will be of particular interest to anyone interested in WWII or holocaust history.\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e91222db73e44825fb23a5b047094ee93b112f3","amp;dn":"Conspiracy+%282001%29+%5B576p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e91222db73e44825fb23a5b047094ee93b112f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,145,34,45,183,62,68,130,95,178,58,91,4,112,148,238,147,177,18,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
