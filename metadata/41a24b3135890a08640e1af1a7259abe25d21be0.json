Klee during his lifetime, was better known for his teaching than for his artistic work. He was an impassioned teacher and left a large body of theoretical work and notes on artistic techniques. This short book of plates of some of his most famous work is a beautiful summary of how his work captures the primitive as well as the alien. It is rich, in both the foreground and the background, that is to say, rather than being completely spontaneous it is well planned and well-thought out: like a mathematician or geometer equations. Yet, most of his work looks spontaneous and fresh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41a24b3135890a08640e1af1a7259abe25d21be0","amp;dn":"Klee+%28Leon+Amiel+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41a24b3135890a08640e1af1a7259abe25d21be0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,162,75,49,53,137,10,8,100,14,26,241,167,37,154,190,37,210,27,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
