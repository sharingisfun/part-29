The bluegrass playing is stellar, full of bullet-fast strumming, picking, and bowing. All the major bluegrass figures are here, from the Stanley Brothers to the Louvin Brothers to Lester Flatt &amp; Earl Scruggs. And while their tunes are generally more programmatic, none of them wanders far from the high, lonesome core, the yearning wail that so enriches the music on this collection&amp;#039;s predecessor, The Best of Bluegrass Volume One: Standards. These are all nominally religious tunes, but they are also virtuoso displays of talent and musical smarts in that oh-so-American genre where the string group handles harmony, rhythm, and melody while also bolstering stunning vocal performances.\n\nInformation Disc:\n?
