For John D. Caputo, GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence is haunted by &quot;perhaps,&quot; which does not signify indecisiveness but an openness to risk, to the unforeseeable. Perhaps constitutes a theology of what is to come and what we cannot see coming. Responding to current critics of continental philosophy, Caputo explores the materiality of perhaps and the promise of the world.
