It was released as a single in August 1987, reaching number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number 2 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and number 12 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was The Cars' 13th and (as of 2011) last Top 40 hit. \n\nRhythm guitarist and principal songwriter Ric Ocasek shares lead vocals with bassist Benjamin Orr on &quot;You Are the Girl&quot;. Both singers had recently cracked the Top 40 with solo hits, Ocasek with 1986's &quot;Emotion in Motion&quot; and Orr with 1987's &quot;Stay the Night&quot;. &quot;You Are the Girl&quot; was The Cars' firstÃ¢â‚¬â€and lastÃ¢â‚¬â€Top 40 hit after their 1987 regrouping following the band members' three-year hiatus to focus on solo work.\n\nThe lyrics for the song are about an ex,  the music video, directed by cult filmmaker John Waters, has been described as &quot;alien-populated&quot;. In 1987, The Cars performed &quot;You Are the Girl&quot; and &quot;Double Trouble&quot; (another track from Door to Door) at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nThe song was recorded for what would be the band's final studio album for the next 25 years, and last ever with its five original members, 1987's Door to Door. It was recorded at a time of personal conflict between the band members. Following the release of the album, there was public speculation that the band was breaking up, and within a year The Cars announced that they had disbanded.\n\nAlthough &quot;You Are the Girl&quot; was The Cars' last Top 40 hit, two more singles released from Door to Door did reach the Top 100: 1987's &quot;Strap Me In&quot; (number 85) and 1988's &quot;Coming Up You&quot; (number 74).\n\n\nThe Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the new wave scene in the late 1970s. The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, with lead singer, rhythm guitarist and songwriter Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. They were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly, then A&amp;R head, in 1977.\n\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with their debut album The Cars which went on to go platinum in late 1978. The Cars' debut album was called a &quot;genuine rock masterpiece&quot; by AllMusic, and was propelled by the success of &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; which had helped get the band signed by Elektra Records.\n\nThe band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek had always discouraged talk of a reunion since then, telling one interviewer in 1997 &quot;I'm saying never and you can count on that.&quot; Bassist Benjamin Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form a spin-off band, The New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material. The surviving original members reunited in 2010 to record a new album, titled Move Like This, which was released May 10, 2011, and a tour to start on the same day.\n\nThe Cars have been an influence on many bands over the years, as evidenced by the list of varied artists that have covered their songs. These include Nirvana (who covered &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; at their last-ever live performance on March 1, 1994), Smashing Pumpkins (&quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot;), Melvins (&quot;Candy-O&quot;), Red House Painters (&quot;All Mixed Up&quot;), Alkaline Trio (&quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;), Ziggy Marley (&quot;Drive&quot;), Poison (&quot;Just What I Needed&quot;), Deftones (&quot;Drive&quot;), and Hayseed Dixie (&quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot;), among others.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_the_Girl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_the_Girl&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/u2k1na5tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/u2k1na5tv/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8500kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Digital Audio 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:56\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
