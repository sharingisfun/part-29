The petition was backed by the Sarasvati Research Trust and demanded that the book be withdrawn. It was addressed to the President of Penguin USA Susan Peterson Kennedy and Mike Bryan, CEO and President of Penguin India.\n\n\nPenguin India has now withdrawn the book and all the unsold copies of the book in any form shall be destroyed soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa8c03616fbe18afa82b3cb6e8d0df66cad2b01e","amp;dn":"The+Hindus+-+An+Alternative+History+by+Wendy+Doniger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa8c03616fbe18afa82b3cb6e8d0df66cad2b01e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,140,3,97,111,190,24,175,168,43,60,182,232,208,223,102,202,210,176,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
