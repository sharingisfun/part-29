I absolutely love plunging my imagination back 200+ years and living the adventures along with two of the greatest characters in fiction.\n\nAfter releasing my first O'Brian torrent 2 years ago, I found that many people wanted the full Aubrey-Maturin series done by either Patrick Tull or Simon Vance. Therefore I have spent months tracking down every single version of every O'Brian novel that exists. I have processed all these unabridged books in the following ways:\n\n1. I ripped ALL of these myself. All 61 books are ripped from high quality CDs. It has taken me 3 years find all of the versions.\n\n2. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took many weeks. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like &quot;end of disc 5, please insert disc 6&quot;) and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.\n\n3. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.\n\n4. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.\n\nAlthough the Aubrey-Maturin series is what first attracted me (and most people) to O'Brian's works, they were not his first novels, nor even his first novels about the sea. In this torrent I believe I have included 100% of his works that are still in print -- that's 26 novels. However, please note that his 3 earliest novels cannot be found in audiobook form.\n\nMost importantly, included are both the full Patrick Tull collection and the full Simon Vance collection of Aubrey-Maturin novels! I have also included 14 additional A-M recordings. This was a massive undertaking but I think and very much hope it will be worth it to all the faithful O'Brian fans out there. :)\n\nPlease leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)\n\nEnjoy!\nCL8\n\n\n-------------Included in this torrent-------------\n1953 - The Catalans (read by Simon Vance)\n1954 - The Road to Samarcand (read by Simon Vance)\n1956 - The Golden Ocean (read by John Franklyn-Robbins)\n1959 - The Unknown Shore (read by Patrick Tull)\n1962 - Richard Temple (read by Graeme Malcolm)\n1969 - AM01 - Master and Commander (read by John Lee)\n1969 - AM01 - Master and Commander (read by Richard Brown)\n1972 - AM02 - Post Captain (read by John Lee)\n1973 - AM03 - H.M.S.
