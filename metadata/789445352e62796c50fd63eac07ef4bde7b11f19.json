Billy Graham and the Pope said they are the same God. If the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is Ã¢â‚¬Å“the GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Islamic Nation,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ then surely they would be in agreement. WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it be interesting to set these two Gods alongside each other and compare them to see if they really are the same God. In this work, Dr. Ruckman does exactly that. He contrasts the God of the Bible (Jehovah, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ) with Ã¢â‚¬Å“the GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of Islam (Allah), and Jesus Christ with Mohammed. Mohammed is revealed (from official Islamic sources) as the fleshy sex-pot and sadistic murderer that he was. How Islam views and treats women is also covered.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree. Reading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:789445352e62796c50fd63eac07ef4bde7b11f19","amp;dn":"Will+The+Real+Allah+Stand+Up%3F+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"789445352e62796c50fd63eac07ef4bde7b11f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,148,69,53,46,98,121,108,80,253,99,234,192,126,244,189,231,177,31,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
