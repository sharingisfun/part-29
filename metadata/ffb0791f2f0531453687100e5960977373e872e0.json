But is that bargain really a bargain?\n\nPaying full price is so passÃƒÂ©. A quarter of the population will only open their wallets if something is on sale. Everyone wants a deal, a steal, a hookup with a discount or a way to cut costs. People donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only want a deep discount, they expect it and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t settle for anything less. \n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re lucky, then, that almost half of everything sold in America is listed at some kind of promotional price. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a seismic shift that has made shoppers more savvy than ever, generating phenomena like extreme couponing, flash sales, and Groupon. \n\nSo thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been a better time to be a buyer, right? Perhaps. Sellers have developed their own tricks to protect profit margins amid such markdown maniaÃ¢â‚¬â€ones that include secret sales, shifting prices, and shredding perfectly good clothes. \n\nIn this playful, deeply researched book, journalist Mark Ellwood takes a trip into this new landscape. He shows how some people are, quite literally, born to be bargain junkies thanks to a quirk of their DNA, and uncovers the sales-driven sleights of hand that sellers employ to hoodwink unsuspecting buyers.\n\nEllwood takes us from the floor of upscale department store Bergdorf Goodman to the bustling aisles of a Turkish bazaar, from the outlet Disney world of rural Pennsylvania to a town in Florida that can claim to be couponingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual capital. We meet savvy buyers trying to wring value from every centÃ¢â‚¬â€stalking fashion editorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tweets to learn about sample sales or camping out overnight for a cut-price computer. \n\nEllwood also uncovers the dark side of discounting: how organized crime steals coupons en masse and how certain boutiques limit discounts to VIPs, \nrunning secret sticker promotions from which the ordinary shopper is excluded. \n\nBargain Fever is a manual for thriving in this new era, when deal hunting has gone from being a sign of indigence to one of intelligence. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been a better time to be a buyerÃ¢â‚¬â€at least if you know how the game works. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb0791f2f0531453687100e5960977373e872e0","amp;dn":"Bargain+Fever%2C+How+to+Shop+in+a+Discounted+World+-+Mark+Ellwood+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb0791f2f0531453687100e5960977373e872e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,176,121,31,47,5,49,69,54,135,16,14,89,96,151,115,115,232,114,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
