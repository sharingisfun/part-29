The lectures were a landmark event, bringing together for the first time in the West a nonsectarian Buddhist and lay audience for over six hours of emotional and intellectually challenging engagement with these central teachings of the Buddhist canon. The impressive intellect and scholarship of His Holiness is everywhere evident in these tapes as he traverses the expansive body of Buddhist scriptures and commentaries. One also catches glimpses of his mischievous sense of humor and, of course, his inspiring compassion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09282ff6e49811578595e71e610f03e841dbf6ed","amp;dn":"%28Dharma%29+Four+Noble+Truths+-+HH+14th+Dalai+Lama+of+Tibet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09282ff6e49811578595e71e610f03e841dbf6ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,40,47,246,228,152,17,87,133,149,231,30,97,15,3,232,65,219,246,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
