Grade Up Coins: A quadruple transformation! Four large silver coins change, two becoming old Japanese coins with holes, each coin a different shape; the other two immediately grow into even larger coins.\n2. 1 = 6: A strange math lesson: One coin splits into two, then splits again and again until there are half a dozen. Then, all six merge back to one.\n3. Bad Tailor: A Sawa classic renewed. A coin penetrates a closed purse, goes back inside, then through the performerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pocket, then back into the purse. Finally, the purse penetrates the pocket, with a great kicker finish.\n4. Tornado Story: Five coins of different sizes represent a family, caught in a cyclone, with amazing results and a happy ending.\n5. Ancient Earring: Four silver coins change into Chinese coins with holes, but thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mild magic compared to the subsequent double change that follows. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never seen an outcome like this!\n6. Lovers: After 30 years, this is SawaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest version of this amorous effect: Two coins are caused to cling together, defying the rules of attraction.\n7. P.O. Box: Innovative magic with an Okito Box, as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcomputer filesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (that look very much like half dollars) are repeatedly sent across cyberspace.\n8. Policeman Heiji: This is Louis FalangaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favorite routine on these DVDs. The audience agreed, as they gave it a spontaneous standing ovation. When you see the multiple payoff, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll agree.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d047ba5f62809eecc493239e3e9fa4f3955987e","amp;dn":"Dr.+Sawa+-+The+New+Coin+Magic+of+Dr.+Sawa+Vol+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d047ba5f62809eecc493239e3e9fa4f3955987e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,4,123,165,246,40,9,238,204,73,50,57,227,233,250,79,57,85,152,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
