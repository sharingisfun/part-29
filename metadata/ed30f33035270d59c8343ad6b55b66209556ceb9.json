The competitive advantage of the series is that it summarises key research on the principles of corrosion and corrosion processes and the solutions offered by surface treatments and engineering coatings. It also discusses innovative production and manufacturing techniques for a broad range of metals and other structural materials in automotive, aerospace, chemical, power generation and the petrochemical industries. The books in the series will be essential reading for metallurgists, materials scientists and engineers, steelmakers and manufacturers, and all those involved in the design of metallic structures and materials development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed30f33035270d59c8343ad6b55b66209556ceb9","amp;dn":"Woodhead+Publishing+Series+in+Metals+and+Surface+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed30f33035270d59c8343ad6b55b66209556ceb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,48,243,48,53,39,13,89,200,52,58,214,181,91,102,32,149,86,206,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
