Sherwin VINE VOICE\n\nTouching You, Touching Me is a very good, affordably priced CD with many &quot;covers&quot; performed by the awesome Neil Diamond. Neil's been around for decades and his talent is clearly the reason why. Neil can take a song and breathe new life into it in a way that very few other contemporary artists can; and he tackles many different types of songs which proves his versatility.\n\n&quot;Everybody's Talkin',&quot; a song written by Fred Neill, starts the CD off with Neil Diamond doing a somewhat country variation on this ballad; Neil's excellent sense of timing and his fine diction bolster his performance very well and &quot;Everybody's Talkin'&quot; makes a strong start for this album. &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; is a song by Jerry Jeff Walker that many artists loved to sing and still love to sing; but when Neil does it he places his own stamp on this tune with his voice that is able to convey every emotion under the sun. &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; is clearly a major highlight of this album.\n\n&quot;Smokey Lady&quot; has Neil rockin' hard and this works well for this tune; the electric guitar and the keyboard work fit in so well with Neil's vocals. What a great song for Neil to perform! Listen also for &quot;Holly Holy;&quot; I have always associated this song with Neil Diamond and the backup chorus is absolutely wonderful. &quot;Holly Holy&quot; is easily another huge highlight of this CD and I could never tire of hearing Neil perform this outstanding tune.\n\n&quot;And The Singer Sings His Song&quot; sports some excellent guitar work as Neil sings this with all his heart and soul; and I really like &quot;Ain't No Way.&quot; &quot;Ain't No Way&quot; has that great Neil Diamond sound and the backup singers harmonize to perfection--and beyond! &quot;New York Boy&quot; is a very pretty tune with a catchy melody and the CD ends well with Neil Diamond performing &quot;Until It's Time For You To Go&quot; written by Buffy Sainte-Marie. &quot;Until It's Time For You To Go&quot; is a most tender bittersweet love song that always touches me when I hear it; and it leaves me wanting more--which is a good sign that this album is a good one.\n\nOverall, Neil Diamond can do just about any type of song he wants to do and make it come off as a masterpiece; this CD proves it. It's too bad that this CD couldn't have offered us a couple more songs, but then again it's well worth the comparatively low price of admission. Neil Diamond fans will like this. I suppose it's also a good CD for people just starting to know Neil Diamond if they want to begin with a budget priced CD.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNeil Diamond - Touching You, Touching Me (MCAD-31052)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Neil Diamond\nAlbum................: Touching You, Touching Me (MCAD-31052)\nGenre................: Vocal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1969\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 57 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: on 1/17/2015\nPosted by............: on 1/17/2015\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
