This book is for people who have an understanding of PhotoshopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basic functions and would like to build on that knowledge. We will build on the basic skills covered in the previous book and we will also be taking a look at several new tools, adjustments, editing methodology and workflow options. We will also cover two ancillary programs that ship as part of the Photoshop package Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Adobe Bridge and Adobe Camera Raw. Photoshop is a large and complex program, and as such, requires practice and patience to develop the skills required to be an effective user. I encourage you to use these three books as a starting point and go on to develop your own workflows and techniques.\n\nPlease Seed to show your gratitude\n\nThis is the second book in this series(first can be found here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10170272/An_introduction_to_Adobe_Photoshop_PDF_TRRG_ )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfb984d591a21c70ecd2202b7cfdf0283d33daf9","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+for+Intermediate+Users+PDF%7BTRRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfb984d591a21c70ecd2202b7cfdf0283d33daf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,185,132,213,145,162,28,112,236,210,32,43,124,253,240,40,61,51,218,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
