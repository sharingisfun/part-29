Also included are a few more issues written by Jim Starlin.  You can just drop these folders in with the previous batch.\nThese are not my scans.  I have been in awe of the folks that turn out such amazing scans and you will find most scans are tagged by their makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.\n\nThis collection has issues from 1976-1993.\n\nThese issues are from First, Malibu, Marvel, and DC\n\nThe format of all the files is either .cbr or .cbz and the language is ENGLISH\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f7662ba30836393a757ec5027fcde973cfe0151","amp;dn":"Jim+Starlin+Cosmic+Chronological+Collection+%5Baddendum%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f7662ba30836393a757ec5027fcde973cfe0151","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,118,98,186,48,131,99,147,167,87,236,80,39,252,222,151,60,254,1,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
