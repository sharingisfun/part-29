Probably the most influential propaganda film of all times. Made by Leni Riefenstahl at the 1934 National Socialist Party Congress in Nurnberg.\n\nSome morons see this as an ode to Nazism. It is not. It's simply an exercise in the cult of personality. Riefenstahl knew instinctively how to &amp;quot;push butons&amp;quot; in her audience's mind - any leader, past or present, would just love to have this kind of film made about him/her.\n\nThis documentary is both revered for its novelty techniques and hated for its efficiency. It has been an object of study for aspiring filmmakers ever since it was released - just ask George Lucas, who lifted the triumphant finale of &amp;quot;Star Wars&amp;quot; directly form Leni Riefenstahl's &amp;quot;magnum opus&amp;quot;.\n\nI'm sure this film is unavailable in Germany, and probably a few other countries as well. So here it is.\n\nI shrunk it at 60%. It may seem a lot, but the original DVD-9 had a bitrate of about 9,000 Mbps. So I challenge anyone here complaining to actually find flaws in the image - age of the film nothwithstanding.\n\nThere's a full commentary from a historian, as well as a second little film by Riefenstahl, rounding up the extras.\n  \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:217d84303ccdf959f2c2ee86cef938ec16ffbf83","amp;dn":"Triumph+of+the+Will","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"217d84303ccdf959f2c2ee86cef938ec16ffbf83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,125,132,48,60,205,249,89,242,194,238,134,206,249,56,236,22,255,191,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
