During a visit to his doctor, he found out that he had cancer.  On medical leave from his job, he started cancer treatment and after several chemoterapy treatments, he began to see invisible evil creatures called echoes.  He takes on odd jobs like investigating philandering husbands, protecting a family from a group of armed thugs, and the oddest job of all, fighting the echoes themselves.  How does a man struggle with his own mortality while trying to help others?  That is Elon's journey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:458954d8d6a9cec9d9a839c4dabf69378f53600c","amp;dn":"Blam%21+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"458954d8d6a9cec9d9a839c4dabf69378f53600c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,137,84,216,214,169,206,201,217,168,57,196,218,191,105,55,143,83,96,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
