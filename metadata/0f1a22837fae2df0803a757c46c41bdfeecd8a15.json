The band was formed in 1990 by Michael Franti and Rono Tse, who had been in the Beatnigs, and introduced the work of guitarist Charlie Hunter. The band's name was derived in part from the phrase &quot;The Disposable Heroes of Hypocrisy&quot;, used in some Socialist literature.\nThe group were associated by genre with others of the time, including House of Pain and Pop Will Eat Itself. They also were somewhat reminiscent of Gil Scott-Heron due to the vocal styles of Franti and the up-front political messages in the music. They played many concerts, sometimes opening the bill for more well-known acts such as U2 (on their landmark Zoo TV Tour), Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana and Arrested Development.\nDisposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy was a Rap group whose music was very politcal, and as history is now showing, was very prophetic and way ahead of its time. The beats are very addictive and the lyrics are simple imspired. If you like the rapper 'Immortal Technique' you will definately like Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy's style and message.\n\nI've not been able to find their music anywhere else on the net so treat yourself to something apparently rare and hard to find. My friend lent me the CD, so ive decided that more peeps need to here the music and message.\n\nRegards.\n\n\nwww.prisonplanet.com\n\nwww.uktruth.co.uk\n\nwww.911truth.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f1a22837fae2df0803a757c46c41bdfeecd8a15","amp;dn":"Disposable+Heroes+of+Hiphoprisy+re+upload","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f1a22837fae2df0803a757c46c41bdfeecd8a15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,26,34,131,127,174,45,240,128,58,117,124,70,196,27,223,238,205,138,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
