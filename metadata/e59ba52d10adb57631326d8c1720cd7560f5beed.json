Taking place in the 21st century, a time when most of the planet has been submerged in water due to the effects of global warming, the game has players leading a team of expert pilots in a series of missions aimed at stopping a militaristic threat. Each campaign begins with a global map, where players can select the mission and receive a briefing on their targets. A choice of pilots, fighters, and armaments is also available.\n\nMissions involve taking off and landing from carriers, engaging in dogfights, taking out specific numbers of ground and sea targets, or linking with other aircraft for midair refueling. To help players succeed, each fighter comes equipped with radar that distinguishes ground targets from enemy fighters. A lock-on reticule allows players to target enemies before they fire their Vulcan cannons, missiles, or rockets. A GPS map, computerized damage system, and radio communication are also included to help players manage their surroundings.\n\nPlayers can pilot their aircraft from three perspectives, including first-person, cockpit, and chase views. In addition to the Campaign, a Training mode offers practice in four mission types. The number of enemies can be set from one to four, with a choice of armaments. Each mission also offers multiple replay views, which can be saved to a memory card. Available planes include the F-14D Super Tomcat, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18E Super Hornet, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-22 Raptor, EF2000 Typhoon, JAS39 Gripen, MiG-29 Fulcrum, and Su-27 Flanker.\n\n\nGame Description Lethal Skies 2:\n\nGlobal warming threatens life on earth. Frozen regions of Siberia have melted, submerging entire countries. As part of an elite group of pilots assembled by the World Alliance, your mission is to take out the World Order Reorganization Front, an organization that exploits natural disasters for its own benefit.\n\nLethal Skies II adds an amazing seven new combat jets for a total of 19 playable planes, arming players with an arsenal necessary to take on an enemy employing an array of conventional and futuristic air, land and sea-based combat vehicles, including battle-mechs, giant mobile fortresses and attack satellites. The game has over 20 unique missions set in battle theaters around the world, and allows players to unlock secret missions where they can play as the enemy. Lethal Skies II provides five different POVs in first and third-person, and 2-player mode that can be played as both split-screen and using the PS2 I.Link. Among additional new and enhanced features are interactive 3D battle maps, movie galleries and cut-scenes that progress the action-packed story with vivid animation.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn both games with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e59ba52d10adb57631326d8c1720cd7560f5beed","amp;dn":"Lethal+Skies+1+%26+2+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e59ba52d10adb57631326d8c1720cd7560f5beed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,155,165,45,16,173,181,118,49,50,109,140,23,32,205,117,96,245,190,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
