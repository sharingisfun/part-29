The RFG are re-organized by Max Lord as a way to bring the League back together, but the Weapons Master amped up their abilities mechanically, unbeknownst to Lord. Booster Gold, Blue Beetle, Fire and Ice race to the rescue, as does Superman after talking to Batman. The RFG's weapons are powerful enough to take down the Man of Steel. Ice calls Power Girl, Metamorpho and Guy Gardner for back up on the way to the park. It isn't enough as the RFG proves more powerful than expected, easily taking out Guy, Ice, Beetle and Metamorpho. Ice then manages to contact Hal Jordan via Guy's power ring, who recruits Crimson Fox, Flash, Aquaman, and Dr. Light. Working together, the heroes defeat the Royal Flush Gang. Pleased with their success, they recreate the two League branches: Justice League America with Superman, Fire, Ice, Beetle, Booster and Guy Gardner; and Justice League Europe with Hal Jordan, Dr. Light, Flash, Elongated Man, Power Girl, Crimson Fox and Aquaman. Metamorpho decides not to join either team at this time.\n\nThanks goes to GWG for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
