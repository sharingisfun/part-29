Voice Throwin' Blues\n\n\nThis collection contains 9 tracks by Harris (Trks 1-9) and 12 tracks by Hawkins (Trks 10-21).\n\nTwo early singer/guitarists have their entire output reissued on this typically definitive release by the European Document label. Actually, William Harris had originally recorded 14 selections but five were unable to be located for this CD; one would later be rediscovered and reissued on a sampler. With the exception of &quot;I'm Leavin' Town,&quot; Harris is heard performing solo and, despite his obscurity, he was a fine second-level blues and folksong performer. Among his better numbers (dating from 1927-1928) are &quot;Kansas City Blues,&quot; &quot;Early Mornin' Blues,&quot; and &quot;Hot Time Blues.&quot; Buddy Boy Hawkins' 12 solos from 1927-1929 find him performing in a similar vein and at a slightly higher level. His &quot;Voice Throwin' Blues&quot; (which over &quot;Hesitatin' Blues&quot; finds Hawkins having a call and response between two of his voices, including one allegedly being a ventriloquist's dummy) is a bit odd. Other selections include &quot;Jailhouse Fire Blues,&quot; &quot;Raggin' the Blues,&quot; &quot;A Rag Blues,&quot; and &quot;Snatch It and Grab It.&quot; Both Harris and Hawkins deserved more opportunities to record but at least these formerly rare recordings (which are in pretty good shape, except for Harris' &quot;Electric Chair Blues&quot;) keep them from being totally lost to history. \n\n\nWilliam Harris/Buddy Boy Hawkins (1927 - 1929)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeae3e08843badc6ffddef793ae306ac6e9efe95","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+William+Harris+%26+Buddy+Boy+Hawkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeae3e08843badc6ffddef793ae306ac6e9efe95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,174,62,8,132,59,173,198,255,221,239,121,58,227,6,172,110,158,254,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
