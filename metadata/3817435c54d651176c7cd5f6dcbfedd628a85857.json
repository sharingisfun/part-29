This is the book that isn't afraid to point out what everyone gets wrong about HTML5's new markup, so you don't make the same mistakes. This is the book that will show you what rocks in HTML5 today and what the future holds for interactivity and video now Flash is dying. This is the book that doesn't think marking up a basic web page should be a quasi-religious exercise where the high priests of HTML5 must be consulted for their interpretation of the holy texts (the HTML5 spec). This is the book that doesn't pull its punches. This is the book for web professionals who think for themselves. This is the book that tells the truth about HTML5.\n\nTitle: The Truth About HTML5\nAuthor: Luke Stevens\nPublisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform\nYear: 2012\nISBN: 978-1479158560\nFormat: PDF - EPUB - MOBI (MOBI Conversion From EPUB).\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
