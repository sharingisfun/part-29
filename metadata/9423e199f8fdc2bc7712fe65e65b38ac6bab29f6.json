Sound becomes your primary means of navigation and your strongest sense.\n\nThe Baka, hunter-gatherer Pygmy people, live in the forests of the Congo basin. In their world of dense green they have always been dependent on listening for survival and are renowned throughout Africa for their music and spiritual dance - &quot;The Dancers of the Gods&quot; as the Pharaohs called them.\n\nThey are now using their skill at music and dance to make a living in today's world.\n\nIn spite of living in a remote forest the Baka have always been interested in the outside world, and especially its music.  In 1992 when Baka Beyond's Martin Cradick and Su Hart first visited a family near the Cameroon - Congo border they found Baka musicians already mixing the Makossa and Soukous they had heard on the radio with their traditional rhythms.\n\nThe Baka's music was so full of their generosity of spirit and joy of life that Martin and Su wanted to bring that spirit back home to Britain. In 1993 they created the band Baka Beyond, mixing the chants and rhythms of the Baka with the songs and melodies of their own Celtic roots.  The album &quot;Spirit of the Forest&quot; was released alongside an album of traditional Baka music, &quot;Heart of the Forest&quot;. Both albums sold worldwide and so started a lifelong cooperation between these 2 British musicians and an extended family of Baka Pygmies from a small village called Banana, 500Km from the nearest tarmac'd road and 10km from the Congo-Cameroon frontier.\n\nMartin and Su returned to the Baka family many times, each time adding a guitar to the Baka's collection. Several young Baka men have now become very proficient guitar players. At the same time multi-tracking recording technology was becoming smaller and more portable and by 2004 Martin began multitracking the Baka songs live in a specially cleared space under a giant tree. The result, &quot;Gati Bongo&quot;, was released in 2006. The songs and guitar playing of the Baka Pygmies could now be shared with the rest of the world and the band, &quot;OrchÃƒÂ©stre Baka GbinÃƒÂ©&quot;, was born. The lucky people who have discovered Gati Bongo on iTunes have been touched by the pure enlightening spirit of the music and have kept it in the iTunes World charts since its release.\n\nMusics:\n\n1.Kopolo 05:18\n2.TopÃƒÂ© MalangÃƒÂ© Bodi 04:37\n3.Mabita Bella 03:54\n4.Pitima (Dusk) 06:16\n5.Tolo Ko Tolo 03:57\n6.Parti dans l'Eau 05:34\n7.Ce N'est Pas la VÃƒÂ©ritÃƒÂ© 04:13\n8.A LÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ  (I'm Sleeping) 06:02\n9.Ima Gati Bongo 06:32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9423e199f8fdc2bc7712fe65e65b38ac6bab29f6","amp;dn":"Orch%26eacute%3Bstre+Baka+Gbn%26eacute%3B+-+Kopolo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9423e199f8fdc2bc7712fe65e65b38ac6bab29f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,35,225,153,248,253,194,188,119,18,254,101,230,91,56,172,107,171,41,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
