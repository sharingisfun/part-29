Parts 1-7 are ready now.  It will be at least 12 hours until part 25 is up.  Part 22 has the last 16km.\n\nSplit into parts at advert breaks to speed transcode and upload.  There is some overlap at the change from Eurosport to ITV4.\n\n\nThis has the double-ascension of Alpe dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Huez but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing repetitive about the route. It stars with the Col de Manse and then crosses the scenic Valbonnais to tackle the easier side of the Col dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ornon. Some have said doing Alpe dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Huez twice is too hard but often the Alpe is approached via the mighty Galibier which stands a kilometre taller than the Alpe so that argumentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s less certain but either way this is a very hard day especially as big crowds will roar the riders up the first ascent of the Alpe. The Sarenne is a tricky climb, one of those optical illusions where the road doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look as if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rising yet the rider struggles. A very technical descent has some riders scared but by now the climbing should have thinned out the bunch before the final climb up the Alpe in front of a delirious crowd.\n\n(profile pic and description from inrng.com/tour/#Stage18)\n\nEurosport live stream, 16:9, 720p, 25fps at 2500kbps transcoded by ffmpeg/x264 to 576p with settings -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset veryfast -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 64000 -ac 2.\n\nSD broadcast, encapsulated 16:9, 576i, 25fps at ~2500kbps transcoded by ffmpeg/x264 to 576p with settings -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset veryfast -vf &quot;yadif=0:-1:0&quot; -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 64000 -ac 2.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24bbffd347a8b78c7f2dff227c6256cfb195cfe2","amp;dn":"Tour+de+France+2013+stage+18+-+Gap+to+Alpe-D%27Huez+172km","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24bbffd347a8b78c7f2dff227c6256cfb195cfe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,187,255,211,71,168,183,140,127,45,255,34,124,98,86,207,177,149,207,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
