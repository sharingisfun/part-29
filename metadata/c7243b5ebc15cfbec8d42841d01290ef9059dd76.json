When a Stranger Calls takes its title and basic premise from the original, which -- for its first 15 minutes or so -- featured Carol Kane as a frazzled babysitter plagued by creepy, invasive phone calls. This time around, the doe-eyed Camilla Belle plays Jill Johnson, a high-schooler dealing with the usual set of crises: an unfaithful boyfriend, a bitchy best friend, and an over-the-limit cell phone bill. In order to pay for the latter, her father (Clark Gregg) has committed her to a babysitting gig with a wealthy family. At the isolated, palatial house, Jill settles in for a night of no-stress kid-watching. But it isn't long before someone starts anonymously calling the house with creepy, increasingly specific messages. Jill doesn't rule out anyone, but it becomes clear that whomever it is, he or she is watching her, and may be closer than she even suspects. \n\nRipped with Handbrake\n\nLength: 1 Hour 27 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 624\n\nFrame Height: 256\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7243b5ebc15cfbec8d42841d01290ef9059dd76","amp;dn":"When+a+Stranger+Calls%282006%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7243b5ebc15cfbec8d42841d01290ef9059dd76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,36,59,94,188,21,207,190,200,212,40,65,208,18,144,239,144,89,221,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
