Written by director Mel Brooks and the star of the film, Gene Wilder, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has all the usual--and in this case slightly unusual--suspects: the reluctant scientist Frederick Frankenstein, who is actually the grandson of the infamous creature-creator (pronounced Fronken-steen and played by Wilder), his spoiled fiancee (Madeline Kahn), Igor the pop-eyed hunchback (Marty Feldman), his dizzy assistant (Teri Garr), the castle&amp;#039;s hideous head housekeeper (Cloris Leachman), and, of course, the Monster (Peter Boyle). And then there are the sets--the original ones used in the Whale films--the beautiful black-and-white cinematography, and the fine screenplay. Combining noirish elegance with uproarious sight gags and double entendres is a feat Brooks pulls off fabulously, directing the wonderful ensemble to act with sensitivity and humanistic feelings as well as with lunatic abandon. YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a treat from beginning to end.\n\nEnjoy\n\nGene","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:461cb3e760203e8f06531709b7ee0d7c14f74258","amp;dn":"Young+Frankenstien","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"461cb3e760203e8f06531709b7ee0d7c14f74258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,28,179,231,96,32,62,143,6,83,23,9,183,238,13,124,20,247,66,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
