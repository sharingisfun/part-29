Taub and R. Paul Singh (CRC, 1998).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0-8493-2646-X\r\n\r\nFood Storage Stability addresses one of the foremost problems faced by food processors - how to stabilize food once it is harvested. Using a holistic approach, the book discusses the changes responsible for food quality deterioration and considers strategies for minimizing or eliminating these degradative changes. Topics include: consumer perceptions and preferences, cellular changes, conversion of major constituents to more stable products, the effect of color and texture, packaging issues, and practical strategies for storing foods frozen, chilled, or at ambient temperature. Food Storage Stability is the only treatment of this subject that covers the diverse factors that influence quality retention in foods and integrates basic concepts in storage stability with practical applications. Food scientists and technologists concerned with changes in food quality are interested in ensuring that safe and appealing food products reach consumers - this is the book that will assist them with that important goal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5af11930b911c15566e4acf515cffb16c33c47","amp;dn":"Food+Storage+Stability","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d5af11930b911c15566e4acf515cffb16c33c47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,90,241,25,48,185,17,193,85,102,228,172,245,21,207,251,22,195,60,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
