That is until the arrival of Batty, a wacky bat who tells the Fairies that he has seen the Humans. Curious, when she sees smoke from Mount Warning, a fairy named Crysta travels beyond Ferngully and discovers a group of humans is destroying the rain-forest. Crysta discovers a human named Zak who is helping destroy the rain-forest and accidentally shrinks him. Once discovering the beauty of Ferngully, Zak and Crysta learn the Fairies and Ferngully itself are in mortal danger, when the humans free Hexxus, a evil oil-like creature who along time ago was turned into a tree when he tried to unleash chaos in Ferngully and has taken over &quot;The Leveler&quot; a logging machine as he begins his evil scheme to destroy Ferngully and only Zak, Crysta, Batty, Pips and The Beetle Boys can defeat Hexxus and save Ferngully from destruction.\n\n\n*          *** FernGully: The Last Rainforest special edition ***              *\n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n*                                                                              *\n       Release Date  : 10 April 1992                                                         \n       Language      : English                                                         \n       Size          : 701 M                                                         \n       Source        : DVDRip                                                         \n       Video Format  : AVI (Xvid)                                                         \n       Resolution    : 704x384 (1.83:1) [=11:6]                                                         \n       FPS           :                                                          \n       Audio Format  : 48000 Hz                                                       \n       Audio Bitrate : 125 kb/s                                                     \n       Audio Channels:  stereo                                                        \n       IMDB          : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104254/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104254/&lt;/a&gt;                                                        \n*                                                                              *\n********************************************************************************\n*                                                                              *\n  Description:    \n\nA man finds himself living among the animals and enchanted spirits of the\n rainforest, and learns of the true consequences of human destruction in this\n animated adventure. Crysta (voice of Samantha Mathis) is a young fairy who\n is being tutored in the powers of magic by the older and wiser Magi (voice\n of Grace Zabriskie) in an Amazon rain forest. While their home was once on\n the verge of destruction thanks to the evil spirit Hexxus (voice of Tim Curry),\n the demon has been trapped inside a tree, and Crysta is free to play with her\n friends Batty Koda (voice of Robin Williams), a bat who escaped from an animal\n testing facility, and Pips (voice of Christian Slater), who has obvious romantic\n intentions toward the attractive young sprite. However, a clear-cutting crew\n destroys the tranquil peace of the rainforest, and when Crysta sees a runaway\n logging machine about to run over lumberjack Zak (voice of Jonathan Ward)\n she saves his life by shrinking him to her own size. However, Crysta isn&amp;#039;t able\n to bring Zak back to his normal size, so he&amp;#039;s forced to live among the forest\n creatures and learn first-hand the devastation the humans have brought to this\n world -- especially when the loggers accidentally free Hexxus from captivity.\n ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide                                                              \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n********************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a396d02fdf12d6ffdb3bb73efc613bc95ed369a","amp;dn":"Fern+Gully+The+Last+Rainforest+Special+Edition+DvDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a396d02fdf12d6ffdb3bb73efc613bc95ed369a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,57,109,2,253,241,45,111,253,179,187,115,239,198,19,188,149,237,54,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
