Wrote the subtitle files and coded it to the movie myself, as well as did the deblocking as much as possible, the sound wasn't much to work with that would work right at the time. So I used what would work in the spaces where needed, the start off has a bit of noise in it but was able to get most of it cleared up in the movie proper, still couldn't get all the laughter out of the audio, but muffled much as possible. The original I worked from was one of MYSTiC's videos.\n\nHope you all enjoy this.\n\nVulcan\n\nMovie info :\nGENRE.........: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller \nIMDB RATING...: 6.4/10 from 21,443 users \nLINK..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440129/\n\nRelease info :  \nRELEASE NAME..: Battleship.2012.HDCam.XviD-MYSTiC\nRELEASE SIZE..: 814 MB                                         \nRUNTIME.......: 2h 1mn\nVIDEO CODEC...: XviD                               \nFRAMERATE.....: 25 fps                                          \nBITRATE.......: 889 Kbps                            \nRESOLUTION....: 704x336 pixels\nAUDIO.........: MP3/256 Kbps/2 channels(STEREO)\nLANGUAGE......: ENGLISH\nSUBTITLES.....: YES (Hard coded English)\nSAMPLE........: YES\nCOVER.........: YES\nDEBLOCKING....: YES (As much as possible to clean up)\nENCODER.......: Vulcan219\n\n\n[IMG]http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/41/vlcsnap2012051611h05m01.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/7464/vlcsnap2012051611h05m41.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/5628/vlcsnap2012051611h09m26.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/3268/vlcsnap2012051611h12m17.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/8863/vlcsnap2012051611h15m15.png[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/107/vlcsnap2012051611h16m54.png[/IMG]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24b005bc390a5fdd6b00cfdfa6004c4faf554583","amp;dn":"Battleship.2012.HDCam.XviD-MYSTiC_xvid-new","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24b005bc390a5fdd6b00cfdfa6004c4faf554583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,176,5,188,57,10,95,221,107,0,207,223,166,0,76,79,175,85,69,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
