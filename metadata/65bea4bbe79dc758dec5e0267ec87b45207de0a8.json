Repo Man \n10. Deathbed Salesman \n11. Tomorrow\n\nTelling stories through song is something of a lost art. Decades ago, it was the norm where songwriters could spin entire worlds in front of our eyes in three and a half minutes. That was replaced by the Ã¢â‚¬Å“hook.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Songs were broken down to a passable chorus or melody with a hummable tune. That was until now.\n\nJeremy Messersmith is a songwriter from a different era. The Reluctant Graveyard is the third and final release in his story on life. While his first two albums focused on the first two stages of life, this most recent piece combines quirky, and sometimes morbid lyrics about our final destination. Song titles like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lazy Bones,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Organ Donor,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Girl, a Boy, and a GraveyardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deathbed SalesmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ would make you think this album would be un-listenable based on the subject matter. You would be 100% wrong.\n\nMessersmith has packaged this concept album in a beautiful 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s-era pop package. He has done what so many imitators have tried to do over the last forty years. He has taken the sound of bands like The Beatles and The Beach Boys and made it his own. The recording is both retro and forward sounding simultaneously. No place is this more obvious, than on the single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Violet!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which screams of Pet Sounds Beach Boys with its subtle piano play and vocal harmonies.\n\nDespite many people outside the Minneapolis not knowing who he is, the talent has not gone un-noticed. The Reluctant Graveyard was chosen as one of the top 10 albums of 2010 by NPRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Songs Considered.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Messersmith has also been featured on the shows Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChuckÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ugly Betty.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEach song tells a story, which is pretty good considering the 11 tracks come to just over 32 minutes of music. No epic songs here. This is storytelling Twitter-style. That being said, not one of these songs sounds unfinished. Each is wrapped in a nice package.\n\nThe opening track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lazy Bones,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ starts off with what sounds like a nod to The Monkees Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last Train to Clarksville.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As it opens up, piano play takes over and the chorus is one you will be singing in the shower for weeks to come.\n\nThe arrangements of each song all seems to fit precisely too. Whether it is the harmonica in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Toussaint, Grey, First in Life and DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the orchestral arrangements in Ã¢â‚¬Å“KnotsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“John the Determinist,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it all works to near perfection. With Ã¢â‚¬Å“JohnÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the violin play is very reminiscent of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eleanor Rigby,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t squash the song as a re-print. Messersmith knows how to take from his influences without blatantly stealing from them.\n\nIn most reviews, there is a spot where the strongest tracks are given, or at least the ones that you, the reader, should give a listen. When it comes to The Reluctant Graveyard, the answer is yes to all. There is not a weak song on the album. Jeremy Messersmith has found a new fan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65bea4bbe79dc758dec5e0267ec87b45207de0a8","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Messersmith+-+The+Reluctant+Graveyard+%5B2010%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65bea4bbe79dc758dec5e0267ec87b45207de0a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,190,164,187,231,157,199,88,222,197,224,38,126,200,123,69,32,125,224,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
