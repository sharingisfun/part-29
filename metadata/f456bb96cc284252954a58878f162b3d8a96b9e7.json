The film is not an adaptation of the play. Robbins' panoramic \nscreenplay tells the story of Cradle's original production and opening night, weaving \nit together with the larger story of the Federal Theatre Project, and the story of \nDiego Rivera's Rockefeller Center mural (Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope \nand High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future -- more on that here, \nhere, and here; also, read E.B. White's poem &quot;I Paint What I See&quot;).\n\nThe graceful juggling of multiple narratives, and the dream ensemble cast, elicited comparisons with the films of Robert Altman. But this movie's clearest antecedent is E.L. Doctorow's Ragtime -- a kaleidoscopic social and political portrait of an era, in which fictional characters mingle with historical figures. Doctorow contributed a dust-jacket blurb to Robbins' published screenplay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f456bb96cc284252954a58878f162b3d8a96b9e7","amp;dn":"O+Poder+Vai+Dan%26ccedil%3Bar+%2F+Cradle+Will+Rock+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f456bb96cc284252954a58878f162b3d8a96b9e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,86,187,150,204,40,66,82,149,74,88,135,143,22,43,61,138,150,185,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
