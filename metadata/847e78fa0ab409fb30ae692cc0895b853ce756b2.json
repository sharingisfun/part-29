Mixed reviews.\n\nI knew Peter was coming into the books as Stone's son but this story really changed things up. While the story took some interesting turns I think it moved a little too quickly for me. I would have liked to see things take just a shade longer than they did. But who knows what Stuart Woods has in store for the next one. We shall see.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:847e78fa0ab409fb30ae692cc0895b853ce756b2","amp;dn":"Stuart+Woods+-+Son+Of+Stone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"847e78fa0ab409fb30ae692cc0895b853ce756b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,126,120,250,10,180,9,251,48,174,105,44,192,137,91,133,60,231,86,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
