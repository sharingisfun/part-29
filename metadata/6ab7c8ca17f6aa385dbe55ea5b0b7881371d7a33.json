He has a following in Europe, and on the basis of this release, he deserves global recognition. Based in Los Angeles, he brings a wonderful, literate turn of lyric to the blues, writing about everyday events and emotions in a way that simply pulls at the heart (listen to the title track for a prime example). Musically he goes for very spare arrangements, just his own guitar work starkly supported at times by bass and drums (and very occasional autoharp), but that's all that's needed. He can sing the blues like a devil, and play pretty damn well, too. He's not afraid of stretching a piece out -- &quot;The New Panama Limited&quot; runs more than ten minutes, for instance -- but they never seem padded. MacLeod has plenty to say and does it in a way that's powerfully hypnotic. The world either needs more as good as him, or perhaps just greater fame for this one. He's a gem, and so is this disc. ~ Chris Nickson\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab7c8ca17f6aa385dbe55ea5b0b7881371d7a33","amp;dn":"Doug+MacLeod+-+A+Little+Sin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab7c8ca17f6aa385dbe55ea5b0b7881371d7a33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,183,200,202,23,246,170,56,93,190,85,234,91,11,120,129,55,29,122,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
