For Germany, this is correct and an excellent accurate detail. \n\nBruno's parents are called Ralf and Elsa, but are only credited as &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot; because that is how Bruno would have known them, and everything in the film is seen from his point of view. \n\nThe character name &quot;Meinberg&quot; translates into English as &quot;My Hill&quot; or &quot;My Mountain&quot;. Director Mark Herman is a Hull City supporter and at the time the Hull goalkeeper was Boaz Myhill. \n\nAlthough the concentration camp where the movie is set is never actually mentioned by name throughout the movie, we know it is Auschwitz because it was the only Nazi death camp with 4 crematoria. The SS officers are discussing the building's construction in the Commandant's office when Bruno's mother interrupts the meeting. In the book it is referred to as &quot;Out-With&quot; (coming from the P.O.V. of Bruno, who is only nine years old and can't pronounce some words properly). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nThe Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) 720p BRrip_sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nvideo details\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
