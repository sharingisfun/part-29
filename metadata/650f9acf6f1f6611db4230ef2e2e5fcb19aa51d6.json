The group has no permanent group line-up, and Johnson has\ncollaborated with a wide range of musicians, changing personnel from project to project.\n\nThe The began recording in 1979/1980 and released their first single ?Controversial Subject? in 1980.\nThe first album release came in 1983, the critically acclaimed ?Soul Mining&quot;, which featured guest\nappearances from Orange Juice (3) drummer Zeke Manyika, Jools Holland, Thomas Leer and\nJ. G. Thirlwell.\n\nJohnson followed with a new album entitled ?Infected? in 1986, recording again with Zeke Manyika,\nplus singer Neneh Cherry, and a number of session musicians. Four singles were released from the\nalbum, with &quot;Heartland&quot; being the most successful, reaching 29 in the UK Chart. The album was\naccompanied by a full length video ?Infected: The Movie? which was shot on location in Bolivia, Peru\nand New York. Johnson toured the world extensively with the movie.\n\nIn 1988, Johnson re-formed The The as a four piece band, having recruited ex-Smiths, The guitarist\nJohnny Marr, bassist James Eller and former ABC drummer David Palmer as full time band members.\nThis line-up recorded the album ?Mind Bomb?, which debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart and\nfeatured the band's highest charting single to that time, &quot;The Beat(en) Generation&quot; hitting 18 in the UK chart.\n\nIn 1989 keyboard player D.C. Collard was added to the line-up and the band embarked on a lengthy\nworld tour in 1989?90 called ?The The Versus The World?, culminating in three sold out gigs at London's\nRoyal Albert Hall at the end of the tour.\n\nIn 1990 the studio EP ?Shades of Blue? was released.\n\nIn 1993, the five-piece line-up (Johnson/Marr/Collard/Eller/Palmer) recorded The The?s fourth album\n?Dusk?, which debuted at No. 2 in the UK. Another world tour followed, the ?Lonely Planet? tour. Johnson\nrelocated the band to America, at which point the band's line-up was reshuffled; Marr and Eller left, and\nwere replaced by guitarist Keith Joyner and bassist Jared Michael Nickerson. Harmonica player\nJim Fitting (formerly of Treat Her Right) joined the band in early 1993. Palmer left the band partway\nthrough the tour and was replaced by ex-Stabbing Westward drummer Andy Kubiszewski. The reshuffled\nband headlined the main stage at the 1993 Reading Festival.\n\nJohnson then permanently relocated to New York, and The The's next project was 1995's ?Hanky Panky?,\nan album that consisted entirely of Hank Williams cover versions. ?Hanky Panky? was recorded by a new\nThe The group, this time consisting of Johnson, Collard, Fitting, guitarist Eric Schermerhorn, bass guitarist\nGail Ann Dorsey, and drummer Brian MacLeod. Their cover version of &quot;I Saw The Light&quot; hit No. 31 in the UK chart.\n\nIn 2000, The The, now consisting of Johnson, Schermerhorn, bassist Spencer Campbell and drummer\nEarl Harvin, released its sixth album ?NakedSelf? and embarked on yet another lengthy world tour,\n?The Naked Tour?, lasting 14 months. ?NakedSelf? remains The The's final released studio album to date.\n\nSince 2003 the reclusive Johnson has kept well away from the public eye and has concentrated primarily\non soundtrack work, scoring numerous documentaries, films and art installations.\nIn April 2014 The The announced that on June 30th 2014 a re-mastered, re-packaged version of\n&quot;Soul Mining&quot; would be released to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of its original release. .\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: The The\nAlbum: Infected\nGenre: Alternative / Rock / Pop / Synth-pop / 80s\nSource: CD\nAlbum Release Year: 1986 [2002 Remastered]\nLabel: Lazarus [Epic]\nBarcode: 5014797671539\nCatalog No: 5 099750 446621\nNumber of Tracks: 8\nTotal Duration: 41:08.20\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.3.1\nEncoding Bit Rate [FLAC]: 993 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME3.99r\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps [Constant Bit Rate]\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 [Stereo]\nAudio Quality: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File ID Tags [FLAC]: VorbisComment\nAudio File ID Tags [MP3]: id3v2.3, id3v1\nIncluded Artwork: Front and back booklet plus inlay\nAdditional Files: Log, Cue, MD5, SFV, FFP, Txt, Foo dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 394 MB\n\n\nTrack List\n\n01.
