The project identified six target species: amur tiger, amur leopard, snow leopard, hooded crane, white-naped crane and black-faced spoonbill. This publication presents information on the processes and outcomes of the NEASPEC nature conservation project for major stakeholders, including governments, national institutions and NGOs, to help shape their own roles in further Subregional actions.
