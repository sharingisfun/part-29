Apart from Willie's son Micah, there are no\nguests here -- just his sister Bobbie on piano, drummer Paul English, Mickey\nRaphael on harmonica, Kevin Smith on bass, Jim &quot;Moose&quot; Brown on organ, and\nBilly\nEnglish batting cleanup on guitar and drum -- and the album sounds as if it\nwere\ncut in the living room late one night, the bandmembers easing into songs\nthey've\nalways loved but never played.\n\nHappy 80th birthday!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6edd3df21e11488a3840fc5813915fa72b88c9a","amp;dn":"Willie_Nelson_And_Family-Lets_Face_The_Music_And_Dance-2013-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6edd3df21e11488a3840fc5813915fa72b88c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,237,211,223,33,225,20,136,163,132,15,197,129,57,21,250,114,184,140,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
