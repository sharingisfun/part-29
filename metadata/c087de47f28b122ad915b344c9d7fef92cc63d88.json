As with the first, the recording features the outstanding combination of the soloist Sergio Azzolini, an acknowledged expert in baroque performance, and the critically acclaimed period instrument group LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aura Soave.\n\nInternationally renowned bassoonist Sergio Azzolini was born in 1967 in Bolzano, Italy. As a baroque bassoon player he is a member of the Ensemble Baroque de Limoges, and appears regularly as soloist with LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aura Soave Cremona, Sonatori della Gioiosa Marca and La Stravaganza KÃƒÂ¶ln. He is also a member of the ensemble Parnassi Musici.\n\nThe group LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aura Soave was formed in 1995 by lutenist and musicologist Diego Cantalupi with the aim of exploring Italian vocal and instrumental traditions and little-known Italian composers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Among the noted soloists with whom it appears are Emma Kirkby, Barbara Hendricks, Sophie Daneman, and Nuria Rial.\n\nIn the last few years LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aura Soave has begun a close collaboration with the bassoonist Sergio Azzolini, whose role as both soloist and director has greatly influenced the orchestra. Its first recording of bassoon concertos by Vivaldi (OP30496) for the NaÃƒÂ¯ve Vivaldi Edition was awarded the prestigious Diapason dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Or in France as best instrumental release of 2010.\n\n\nTracks:\n\nBassoon Concerto, RV 499 in A minor\nBassoon Concerto, RV 472 in C major\nBassoon Concerto, RV 490 in F major\nBassoon Concerto, RV 496 in G minor\nBassoon Concerto, RV 504 in B flat major\nBassoon Concerto, RV 483 in E flat major\nBassoon Concerto, RV 470 in C major","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c087de47f28b122ad915b344c9d7fef92cc63d88","amp;dn":"Vivaldi%3A+Bassoon+Concertos+Volume+2+%26middot%3B+Azzolini%2C+L%27Aura+So","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c087de47f28b122ad915b344c9d7fef92cc63d88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,135,222,71,242,139,18,42,217,21,179,68,201,215,254,249,44,198,61,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
