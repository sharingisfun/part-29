Now we can give you 5.1 sound and you can start complain how blind and deaf I am :P\n\n1. UNFINISHED movies HAVE synchro problemms. This is the nature of highly commpressed content. Download THE WHOLE file then you will be happy.\n2. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you actually seen it. I am being the target for many angry TROLLS, which would like to DISMISS my work for unknown to me reasons and they have succeded in some areas. If you HAVE LIKED this release tell others about it. If you dont tell it too but dont forget to tell why.\n3. This file will work directly on PS3 (tested) and many standalone h264 capable players (nontested, confirmation anybody??)\n4. This file will not work directly on XBOX, because Microsoft artificially limits its capabilities to Main Profile for Video and Stereo AAC LC for sound. Maybe this tip will help you. The main compatibility issue is that High Profile files will not show up in the Zune software, and therefore, not show up on the Xbox 360 for playback - the only way around this at the moment is to copy the file to a USB drive or CD/DVD media and play the file from there (hopefully a software fix will solve this problem in Zune). Sorry guys if it wont help you, but at this level of size you should complain to Microsoft only.\n5. My releases are different than anybody else, so they SHOULD NOT be compared to any existing scene rules. I belive if there are different rules for Telecine and for DVDRip there can be also different rule for FASM X264 releases. If the scene will overregulate itself, prohibiting new ideas to come it will soon become like our goverments.\n6. If you like the movie, gratitude the creators by going to cinema, buying Bluray/DVD or any other possible way.\n7. The movies can be directly streamable throught WWW, by Adobe Flash Player version 9 or higher.\n8. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. If you write something directly in assembler it is usually much faster and takes much less size, than the same thing written in C, Java etc... It also means FAchman SoofMan - founders of FASM :)\n9. FASM Video Technique is the h264 commpression method optimised directly for lowbitrate HD content. It is constantly being improved, each revision bringing quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard x264 encoding is explained by the same reason XVID encodes are better than DIVX3.\n10. FASM Audio Technique is the AAC commpression method optimised directly for lowbitrate HD content.\n \nRegards to true scene members and disregard to lamers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23fec01037a4fb8647fd3425960192a160c02251","amp;dn":"Blood+The+Last+Vampire+2009+BDRip+FASM+X264+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23fec01037a4fb8647fd3425960192a160c02251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,254,192,16,55,164,251,134,71,253,52,37,150,1,146,161,96,192,34,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
