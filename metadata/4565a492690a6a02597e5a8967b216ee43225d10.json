All products can used be used with the free GUITAR RIG PLAYER software, or expand the arsenal of the upcoming new GUITAR RIG 5.\n\nBased on sophisticated component modeling, the SOLID MIX SERIES recreates the essential components of a classic mixing desk whose sonic signature has shaped popular music. The series consists of three individual modules that provide the tools to create a polished and professional-sounding mix. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Solid EQÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ emulates the legendary equalizer section of the console with its 4 parametric bands as well as the adjustable low-cut and high-cut filters, which allows for especially musical and transparent sound shaping of all signal types. Switchable EQ types also offer the selection between two distinctive generations of the original hardware with their specific sound characteristics.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Solid Bus CompÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an authentic emulation of the sought-after bus compressor, renowned for the way that it Ã¢â‚¬Å“gluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mixes together and singlehandedly creates a Ã¢â‚¬Å“finishedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ studio production sound. Taking advantage of the new features of the GUITAR RIG 5 generation, it also provides a sidechain input as well as a dry/wet control for parallel compression. As the third component, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Solid DynamicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides a combined dynamics section with stereo compressor, expander and gate that lends itself to the precise dynamics processing of individual tracks.\n\nTRANSIENT MASTER is inspired by a highly popular modern studio processor, and provides a unique and especially efficient method to treat drums and percussive instrument sounds by directly reshaping the envelope of the signal. Through the Ã¢â‚¬Å“AttackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“SustainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ parameters of the software, TRANSIENT MASTER can both add natural punch and definition, or blend individual instruments further back into the mix, without any of the sonic artifacts associated with regular compression methods.\n\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nWindows 7 (latest Service Pack, 32/64 Bit), Intel Core Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n\nruns in the free GUITAR RIG 5 PLAYER and GUITAR RIG 5 PRO.\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uninstall previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install\n\n\n         Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
