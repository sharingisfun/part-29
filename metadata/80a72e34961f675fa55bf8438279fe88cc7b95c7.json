Karyuudo Fansubs's release is becoming harder to find, and some people don't want to download an entire DVD.  Subs were animated and hard-coded.\n\n\nBackground:\nOriginally intended to be a full TV series, Transformers: Zone was forced to become a direct-to-video (OVA) due to less than expected toy sales. Although rumors have always circulated that as many as five could have been completed, only this first episode was released, and serves as the final animated installment of the Japanese Generation 1 cartoon.\n\n\nPlot:\nFollowing on from Transformers: Victory, the mysterious three-faced insectoid being, Violenjiger dispatches the nine &quot;Great Decepticon Generals&quot; - Devastator, Menasor, Bruticus, Trypticon, Predaking, Abominus, King Poseidon, Overlord and BlackZarak - to acquire &quot;Zone Energy,&quot; destroying the planet Feminia to obtain the world's store. Caught in the destruction of the planet, Star Saber is rescued by Dai Atlas, who then repels an attack by the Decepticons, and is appointed the new Autobot commander at the conclusion of the episode.\n\n\nThanks:\nKaryuudo Fansubs deserves a lot of credit for this release.  Without their DVD source, translating, timing, and subbing, this would not have been possible. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://karyuudofansubs.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://karyuudofansubs.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3427491/Zone_DVD_(eng_subs)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3427491/Zone_DVD_(eng_subs)&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80a72e34961f675fa55bf8438279fe88cc7b95c7","amp;dn":"Transformers.Zone.1990.DVDRip.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80a72e34961f675fa55bf8438279fe88cc7b95c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,167,46,52,150,31,103,95,165,91,248,67,130,121,254,136,204,123,149,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
