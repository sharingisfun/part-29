In this course, David Gassner shows you how to pair XAML with Visual Basic to build a simple data-driven application. He provides a tour of the free Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8 and runs through a few Hello World exercises before demonstrating how to perform most of the basic app programming tasks with XAML and Visual Basic. The course describes how to acquire and display data, add an app bar, and use Windows 8 contracts to share assets with other applications.\n\nTopics include:\nInstalling Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8\nTesting apps with the Windows 8 simulator\nDefining a split-page layout with XAML\nRetrieving and parsing XML files with asynchronous programming\nDisplaying data with dynamic bindings\nSharing data with other apps through contracts\nDisplaying command buttons in an app bar\nCreating Live Tile notifications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9cb2fecea47f2bcb8ac6eb021a805e254ef9875","amp;dn":"Building+Your+First+Windows+Store+App+with+XAML+and+Visual+Basic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9cb2fecea47f2bcb8ac6eb021a805e254ef9875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,203,47,236,234,71,242,188,184,172,110,176,33,168,5,226,84,239,152,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
