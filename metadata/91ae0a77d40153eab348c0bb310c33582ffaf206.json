The quest takes Captain and his crew from the shores of Blood Island to the foggy streets of Victorian London\nAfter years of humiliation and failed attempts to win the coveted Pirate of the Year Award, Pirate Captain and his oddball crew take on the cream of the pirating crop - Black Bellamy, Peg Leg Hastings and Cutlass Liz - in a race to pillage the most booty. They soon cross paths with lovelorn scientist Charles Darwin, who persuades the Captain that the crew's prized 'parrot', Polly, could be the answer to the 'untold riches' they are searching for. Their adventure takes them to Victorian London where they meet Darwin's sidekick 'man-panzee' Mister Bobo, and the notorious pirate-hating Queen Victoria herself. It soon unfolds that Darwin's motives for helping the crew are not what they seem, and the Queen has an evil hidden agenda of her own. The Pirate Captain must choose between basking in the glory of being crowned Pirate of the Year, or staying faithful to his trusted crew\n\nThe film is based on Gideon Defoe's novels 'The Pirates! in an Adventure with Scientists' (the Pirates encounter Darwin and Bobo) and 'The Pirates! in an Adventure with Whaling' (the Pirates face off against Cutlass Liz) \n\nGreetz:\nNOVA-AsA-SaM-IFLIX-ELEKTRI4KA-SAFC-LKRG-MEMORY100-Unevano-asttas-Feel-Free-SceneLovers - PADDO\nIPT-LU-TA-VISION-NOIR-T0XiC-MTV-Rx-iNK-HiVE-CM8-LEGi0N-killerhz-FLAWL3SS-UnKnOwN-26K - NoZGT - HOPE\nSAFCuk009+Fabreezy-Kingdom-PrisM-ETRG-MAGNAT-PDU-LAP-Samurai RG-botzo -TaRiQ786 - BBnRG - TRiNiTY\n\n[img]http://img804.imageshack.us/img804/1779/vlcsnap2012041414h44m41.png[/img]\n[img]http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/7699/vlcsnap2012041414h44m47.png[/img]\n[img]http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/5773/vlcsnap2012041414h44m49.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ae0a77d40153eab348c0bb310c33582ffaf206","amp;dn":"The+Pirates%21+Band+of+Misfits+2012+CAM+XVID-WBZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ae0a77d40153eab348c0bb310c33582ffaf206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,174,10,119,212,1,83,234,179,72,192,187,49,12,51,88,47,250,242,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
