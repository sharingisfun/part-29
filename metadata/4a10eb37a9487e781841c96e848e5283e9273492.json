The duo starts big with the title track--Jack's fast-tumbling, falsetto-tinged lyrics jagging on hyper keyboard-sounding segues and Meg's pounding drums. They rarely shy from an idea, invoking acoustic Bob Dylan to frame &quot;300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues,&quot; but interjecting a series of distortion-laden guitar paroxysms for good measure. The end of Icky, on &quot;Effect and Cause,&quot; is where Jack's trademark vocal warble and spare, quick acoustic strums meet Meg's single-minded beats. Everywhere on Icky giant riffs leap and shout, with Flamenco horns and those eerie bagpipes and rhythmic shifts and Jack's impatient vocal kinetics, marking new territories even as the White Stripes again populate them with vintage ideas. \n\nThe White Stripes are back with the most bombastic album they've ever produced! While revealing the band's roots in American folk music, Icky Thump is an explosive, revolutionary assault that brings together garage rock, every blues style of the past 100 years, nouveau, and flamenco. This is truly a modern rock and roll masterpiece! \n\nby Andrew Bartlett\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Icky Thump.wma                                                  \n02 - You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do What You're Told).wma  \n03 - 300 M.P.H.
