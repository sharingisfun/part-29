The only thing wrong is that there should be more of them - only three tracks after 1969.  Essential for Elvis fans.  I think I posted these some years ago.  There are lots of new faces here since then so they're worth putting back on the tracker.  New scans for Box 4 as I couldn't find any and I don't think I ever got around to them.  Boxes 1-3 are the original scans I did way back when.  Completely new rip.\n\t \n  \t \t \t  \t \nSet List:\n\nVolume 05\n \t \t\n01 I'm Comin' Home (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n02 I'm Comin' Home (take 3)\n03 I'm Comin' Home (take 4)\n04 I'm Comin' Home (take 5)\n05 I'm Comin' Home (takes 6 &amp; 7)\n06 Gently (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n07 Gently (take 3)\n08 Gently (take 4)\n09 Gently (takes 5 &amp; 6)\n10 In Your Arms (take 1)\n11 In Your Arms (take 2)\n12 Give Me The Right (take 1)\n13 Give Me The Right (takes 2 &amp; 3)\n14 Give Me The Right (take 4)\n15 I Feel So Bad (take 1)\n16 I Feel So Bad (take 2)\n17 It's A Sin (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n18 It's A Sin (takes 3 &amp; 4)\n\nVolume 06\n\n01 I Want You With Me (take 1)\n02 I Want You With Me (take 2)\n03 There's Always Me (take 1)\n04 There's Always Me (take 2)\n05 There's Always Me (takes 3 &amp; 4)\n06 There's Always Me (takes 5-9)\n07 There's Always Me (take 10)\n08 Starting Today (take 1)\n09 Starting Today (take 2)\n10 Starting Today (take 3)\n11 Sentimental Me (take 1)\n12 Sentimental Me (take 2)\n13 Judy (take 1)\n14 Judy (takes 2 &amp; 3)\n15 Judy (take 4)\n16 Judy (takes 5 &amp; 6)\n17 Judy (take 7)\n18 Judy (take 8)\n19 Put The Blame On Me (takes 1 &amp; 2)\n20 Put The Blame On Me (takes 3-5)\n\nVolume 07\n\n01 Something Blue (takes 3 &amp; 4)\n02 Something Blue (take 6)\n03 Something Blue (take 7)\n04 Gonna Get Back Home Somehow (takes 3 &amp; 5)\n05 Gonna Get Back Home Somehow (take 4)\n06 Gonna Get Back Home Somehow (take 6)\n07 Gonna Get Back Home Somehow (take 7)\n08 Such As Easy Question (take 5)\n09 Fountain Of Love (take 9)\n10 Fountain Of Love (take 10)\n11 Just For Old Times Sake (take 5)\n12 Night Rider (take 5)\n13 You'll Be Gone (take 3)\n14 You'll Be Gone-South Of The Border (take 4)\n15 I Feel That I've Known You Forever (take 5)\n16 Just Tell Her Jim Said Hello (take 3)\n17 Just Tell Her Jim Said Hello (take 4)\n18 Just Tell Her Jim Said Hello (take 6)\n19 suspicion (take 5)\n20 She's Not You (take 5)\n\nRipped by Ozark and uploaded to Hunger City February 2012\n\n\nNotes From Elvis On CD\n\nThe second of a series of four wonderful boxsets in an outstanding sound quality.
