He is consumed with investigating and finding the murderer of his wife, Michelle, and their infant child. Trevor, Max's snitch, supplies information that leads Max to three drug addicts in an empty train station. They attempt to rob Max in a bathroom; instead, Max interrogates one of them about his familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s murder, with no results. At Trevor's apartment, Max meets Natasha Sax, who gets into an argument with her sister, Mona. When Natasha storms off, Max searches for her in the back where partiers are using the drug &quot;Valkyr&quot;. Max is silently confronted by Jack Lupino, but Natasha takes Max back to the party. Max notices NatashaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tattoos and wants information about them, so he invites her back to his apartment. However, when Natasha tries to seduce Max, she makes insensitive comments about his wife and Max kicks her out. The next morning, Natasha is found dead, and Max's wallet is discovered at the crime scene. Max becomes the prime suspect in the case, with his old partner, Alex Balder, taking part in the investigation. Alex notices the tattoo on Natasha's arm is similar to one found in the case file of Max's wife. Alex tries to contact Max, but with no response, he quickly leaves for Max's apartment. When Max arrives home, he finds the door ajar and his place a mess. Alex lies dead inside and as Max investigates he is knocked unconscious from behind.\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Drama\n\nRelease date: 14 November 2008 (UK)\n\ncast\n\nMark Wahlberg\nMila Kunis\nBeau Bridges\nChris &quot;Ludacris&quot; Bridges\nChris O'Donnell\nDonal Logue\nAmaury Nolasco\nKate Burton\nOlga Kurylenko\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Max Payne 2008 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1840.14 MiB\nDuration: 1h 42mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 498 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/43639641192154522009.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/43639641192154522009.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72472678550779336589.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/72472678550779336589.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12193901600850040536.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12193901600850040536.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/51895141596961550543.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/51895141596961550543.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/50286586523190054402.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/50286586523190054402.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/06155570144189698634.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/06155570144189698634.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollow us on Facebook \n\nFollow us on Twitter ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a94e56158f04cde064233712cda988a471d1f1d","amp;dn":"Max+Payne+2008+720p+BRRip+x264+aac++vice%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a94e56158f04cde064233712cda988a471d1f1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,148,229,97,88,240,76,222,6,66,51,113,44,218,152,138,71,29,31,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
