Ever since, Leuchter's claims have been attacked. In 1993, Rudolf, a researcher from the prestigious Max Planck Institute, published a thorough forensic study about the 'gas chambers' of Auschwitz. His report irons out the deficiencies and discrepancies of &quot;The Leuchter Report.&quot; The Rudolf Report was the first English edition of this sensational scientific work. This new edition analyzes all existing evidence on the Auschwitz gas chambers and offers even more evidence. The conclusions are startling. Appendix describes Rudolf's unique persecution--this brilliant scientist was so feared by the mainstream holocaust establishment that they banned him from writing about or researching the subject as terms of his release from prison!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca3f9b2f87d2390c5da6aea4c7a53dc55e5bff7","amp;dn":"The+Rudolf+Report%3A+Expert+Report+on+Chemical+and+Technical+Aspec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca3f9b2f87d2390c5da6aea4c7a53dc55e5bff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,163,249,178,248,125,35,144,197,218,106,234,76,122,83,220,85,229,191,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
