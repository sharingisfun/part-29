The book assumes only a basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts (variables, functions, expressions, statements) and requires no prior knowledge of C or any other particular language. It reduces the usually considerable complexity of C++.\n\nThe included lessons allow you to learn by doing, as a participant of an interactive education session. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll master each step in a one sitting before you proceed to the next. Author Ray Lischner has designed questions to promote learning new material. And by responding to questions throughout the text, youll be engaged every step of the way.\n\nAuthor: Ray Lischner\nPublisher : Apress\nFormat : PDF\nISBN-10 : 1590597494\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6efda2ed6c69d1fac59b7232fe75d45452cf1b3","amp;dn":"Exploring+C%2B%2B+The+Programmers+Introduction+-+2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6efda2ed6c69d1fac59b7232fe75d45452cf1b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,239,218,46,214,198,157,31,172,89,183,35,47,231,93,69,69,44,241,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
