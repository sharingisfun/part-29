For most of its operational life, from 1969 to date, its contribution to the defense of the realm and its role in offensive duties was, of necessity, often shrouded in secrecy. It was the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœeye in the skyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which was absolutely vital to a host of activities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, to support of land battles throughout the world, to the Falklands campaign, to combating drug-running, the NimrodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unsung role was paramount. Now the UK is bereft of such a multitasking reconnaissance aircraft. The full story of the Nimrod, and its significance, has now been told. Tony Blackman, who was there at the beginning, test-flew nearly every aircraft and was at Kinloss on the very day the project was canceled, has written this timely book, covering every facet of its history, its weapons system developments and its tragic accidents.\n\nAmazon.co.uk title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Nimrod-Rise-Fall-Tony-Blackman/dp/1908117796&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Nimrod-Rise-Fall-Tony-Blackman/dp/1908117796&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5801e2e8f72350a94a19f6a0b035384fadd77280","amp;dn":"Nimrod%3A+Rise+and+Fall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5801e2e8f72350a94a19f6a0b035384fadd77280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,1,226,232,247,35,80,169,74,25,246,160,176,53,56,79,173,215,114,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
