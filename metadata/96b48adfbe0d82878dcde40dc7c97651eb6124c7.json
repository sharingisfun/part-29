ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines are continually being updated and often overlap in their advice, making it difficult for the cardiologist to obtain a clear picture of the right way to diagnose and treat disease according to the latest evidence base. Written by leading authorities in the field, this book, together with its twice yearly-updated online version, provides a solution. The authors have scrutinized all available guidelines and research, collating the results into over 600 easily-accessible tables which provide the most recent recommendation by both ACC/AHA and the ESC on every clinical issue. These recommendations are considered in the context of the latest research and evolving evidence most relevant to the clinician, to give detailed insights into how best to proceed with treatment. This is discussed as part of 84 comprehensive chapters on pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. Each chapter offers concise information on definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of the disease, reflecting the latest published research. Following this is clear and instructive discussion of possible presentations and all clinical investigations that may be necessary. The authors have rigorously examined the implications of published guidance, and where appropriate considered new evidence that questions the validity of specific recommendations, as well as the opinion of established experts and other data such as FDA alerts. This guidance is supported by over 140 full-colour images, which reinforce key points and clarify difficult concepts. The online version is updated twice a year to ensure a continuously up-to-date reference source over time, which will establish itself as an essential part of everyday practice. Accompanied by a year's free access to the online version and providing at-a-glance access to the best guidance in cardiology, Clinical Cardiology: Current Practice Guidelines offers a diagnosis and management toolkit which no cardiologist can afford to be without.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96b48adfbe0d82878dcde40dc7c97651eb6124c7","amp;dn":"Clinical+Cardiology%2C+Current+Practice+Guidelines+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96b48adfbe0d82878dcde40dc7c97651eb6124c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,180,138,223,190,13,130,135,141,205,228,13,199,201,118,81,235,97,36,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
