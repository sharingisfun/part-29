The media seized hold of the story and, in the process, helped to launch one of the most devastating health scares ever. In the years to come Wakefield would be revealed as a profiteer in league with class-action lawyers, and he would eventually lose his medical license. Meanwhile one study after another failed to find any link between childhood vaccines and autism.\n\nYet the myth that vaccines somehow cause developmental disorders lives on. Despite the lack of corroborating evidence, it has been popularized by media personalities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jenny McCarthy and legitimized by journalists who claim that they are just being fair to Ã¢â‚¬Å“both sidesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of an issue about which there is little debate. Meanwhile millions of dollars have been diverted from potential breakthroughs in autism research, families have spent their savings on ineffective Ã¢â‚¬Å“miracle cures,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and declining vaccination rates have led to outbreaks of deadly illnesses like Hib, measles, and whooping cough. Most tragic of all is the increasing number of children dying from vaccine-preventable diseases. \n\n448 pages\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster; First Edition edition (January 11, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439158649\nISBN-13: 978-1439158647","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09e90991f16ca12507dda79d60363d9f44459faf","amp;dn":"The+Panic+Virus%3A+A+True+Story+of+Medicine%2C+Science%2C+and+Fear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09e90991f16ca12507dda79d60363d9f44459faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,233,9,145,241,108,161,37,7,221,167,157,96,54,61,159,68,69,159,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
