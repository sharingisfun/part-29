Caldwell then writes wholly fictitious descriptions of the planets and creatures in the paintings. Probably intended for a slightly younger reader (the kind of thing that would have occupied my imagination for hours in the days before constant video game playing and computer use), I still found this pretty entertaining (but then, I'm a huge SF geek, which probably helps).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7e74294e9d2fe6345c7d889e9a65fadbc29130","amp;dn":"Steven+Caldwell+-+Aliens+In+Space","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7e74294e9d2fe6345c7d889e9a65fadbc29130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,126,116,41,78,157,47,230,52,92,125,136,158,154,101,250,219,194,145,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
