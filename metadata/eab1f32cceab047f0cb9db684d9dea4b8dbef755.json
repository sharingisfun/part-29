The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Former art school students who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene,\r\nTalking Heads integrated elements of punk, art rock, funk, and dance music with avant-garde sensibilities to become a pioneering post-punk and new wave group. Fronted by the anxious stage persona of frontman Byrne, the group produced several commercial hits and a number of multimedia projects throughout its career, and often collaborated with other artists, such as musician Brian Eno and director Jonathan Demme.\r\n\r\nCritic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Talking Heads as &quot;one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of the band's albums appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and three of their songs (&quot;Psycho Killer&quot;, &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, and &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;) were included among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Talking Heads were also included at #64 on VH1's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.\r\nTalking Heads have been cited as an influence by many artists, including R.E.M., Vampire Weekend,Primus, Bell X1, The Ting Tings, Nelly Furtado and Radiohead, who took their name from the Talking Heads song &quot;Radio Head&quot; from the 1986 album True Stories.\r\nThe Italian filmmaker and director Paolo Sorrentino, in receiving the Oscar for his film La Grande Bellezza in 2014, thanked Talking Heads among others as his sources of inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe Best of Talking Heads is a 2004 compilation album by Talking Heads, released by Sire/Warner Bros./Rhino, and contains in all 18 tracks, from the beginning to the end of Talking Heads' history. It was released the same day (August 17, 2004) as the expanded reissue of The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads.\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nAll songs written by David Byrne, except where noted.\r\n\r\n&quot;Love ?
