As a woman with a strong traditional background, she found a way to marry contemporary sounds and sensibilities with her bedrock country and bluegrass history, and, with the help of producer Paul Worley, delivered a complete, believable, and very fetching record. But Restless sounds as if she and Worley just went in and cut a passel of songs. A lot of them carry a message of hope, of making &quot;something magic out of something frightening,&quot; as she sings in &quot;Rockin&amp;#039; Horse,&quot; one of five tracks she co-wrote. But most of them just sound as if she had getting on radio more in mind than anything else. It?s hard to tell if the album doesn&amp;#039;t know what it wants to be, or if it?s Evans who?s confused. Worley over-produced the majority of it with unnecessary layers and busy arrangements, and the repertoire ranges all over the place, from an awful attempt at swaggering R&amp;B (&quot;Big Cry&quot;) to the hay-bale-and-pickup milieu of &quot;Suds in the Bucket.&quot; While the languid and affecting &quot;Backseat of a Greyhound Bus&quot; sticks in the memory and the sensual &quot;Otis Redding&quot; gets the hormones charged, too many of the songs just roll by. Evans remains a wonder of a singer, however, whether she?s projecting her clearer pop voice or calling on the nasality of her Missouri barn-dance-and-bluegrass training, something in too short supply on this uneven effort\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
