One unforgettable love story.\nIn the spring of 1941, young Jon MeyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family dies in a tragic accident, and he is sent to live in a small Indiana town. He arrives to find himself unwanted and shunned.\n\nMary Dahlgren is the mayorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter. A pretty girl, she could have the pick of the boys in town, including Vernon King, the star of the vaunted high school basketball team. To the chagrin of her friends, though, Mary has always been more interested in books than boys. That is, until she meets Jon.\n\nBut Jon and Mary are kept apart through the efforts of MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, who perceives their relationship a threat to his political aspirations, and Vernon, to whom Jon is a rival for MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affections. For months Jon is subjected to a painful ostracism. Then, just when the young manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earnestness and perseverance begin to win over many of the townsfolk, and it appears that love may conquer all, tragedy strikes.\n\nAs the country is caught up in war, so too are the young lovers swept up in events beyond their control, leaving both fighting for their very lives. If, against the odds, they are to be together, each will need to find the strength, the courage and the resourcefulness that beat only in a defiant heart.\n\nGenre: Historical fiction | Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21b68b1289787c79f6492186a31d47b951dd743","amp;dn":"Defiant+Heart+by+Marty+Steere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21b68b1289787c79f6492186a31d47b951dd743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,27,104,177,40,151,135,199,159,100,146,24,106,49,212,123,149,29,215,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
