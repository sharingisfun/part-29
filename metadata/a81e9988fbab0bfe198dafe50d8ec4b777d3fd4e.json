Fascinating and engaging, this text will help you answer two fundamental questions: What are we? How do we know? Crafting a story about astronomy, Seeds shows you how to ask questions to gradually puzzle out the beautiful secrets of the physical world and our place in it. This edition addresses the newest developments and latest discoveries in the exciting study of astronomy, including new data on Jupiter's ring system; new observations of the shapes of stars; new evidence of dark energy, quasars, and galaxy collisions; and a look inside supernova explosions.\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 464 pages\n# Publisher: Brooks Cole; 7 edition (January 1, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1439050368\n# ISBN-13: 978-1439050361\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81e9988fbab0bfe198dafe50d8ec4b777d3fd4e","amp;dn":"The+Solar+System%2C7th++Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81e9988fbab0bfe198dafe50d8ec4b777d3fd4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,30,153,136,251,171,11,254,25,141,175,229,13,142,196,183,119,211,253,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
