If you enjoy the book please think about purchasing a copy. If you repost the torrent please include the descriptions and links below.\n\n\nCover art by Raro:\n\nSummary\n\nJon Gray returns along with his best friend Sorus Nightwalk as they travel to the newly freed island nation of Cawl in search of the Sword of Water. Directed by his enigmatic brother Valari, Jon arrives on the island and quickly finds out the king of the nation is off on a quest but a regent rules in his stead. With permission from Granatz the Black the two heroes set off towards the Central Mountain where rumors of the Sword of Water persist thousands of years after it legendarily ousted the great Fire Elemental twins Eleniak and Hezfer from their citadel.\n\nYoung Prince Jerichi and his friend Silenia follow the two champions into the adventure of a lifetime. They journey from the great mountain to the restive city-state of Serapis where SileniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, High Priest Amalagaz, plots against the prince and hopes to usurp control of the newly founded nation.\n\nMuddying the plot is the fact that Eleniak is still alive, blames the Sword of Water for the death of her twin, and plots vengeance against the Water Elemental Silenia. The great fiery ruler manipulates events so that she can lure the Water Elemental from her ancient hiding place.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a battle of courage against fear, a fight for a newly founded nation to survive political turmoil, and a question if young Silenia will lure her namesake into the grasp of Eleniak. Can Jon Gray navigate these tumultuous waters safely or will the young Knight of Gray meet a foe more powerful than even he can manage?\n\nFind out in The Sword of Water; a Tales of Corland adventure featuring Jon Gray.\n\nPurchase Information\nThe Sword of Water: $2.99\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/The-Sword-of-Water-ebook/dp/B00AOLJUXI/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355588771&amp;sr=1-1\n\nBarnes and Noble: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/books/1045445121?ean=2940016081557\n\nSmashwords: https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/265434\n\nPrevious Novels\n\nThe Staff of Naught: $2.99\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Staff-Naught-Tales-Corland-ebook/dp/B004VMTVUS\n\nBarnes and Noble: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-staff-of-naught-tom-liberman/1030759911\n\nSmashwords: https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/92177\n\nThe Staff of Sakatha: $2.99\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Staff-Sakatha-Tales-Corland-ebook/dp/B005C1N2AW\n\nBarnes and Noble: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-staff-of-sakatha-tom-liberman/1104228077\n\nSmashwords: http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/75248\n\nThe Hammer of Fire: $2.99\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0086ZSGUW \n\nBarnes and Noble: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-hammer-of-fire-tom-liberman/1111260629?ean=2940014369381\n\nSmashwords: https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/166564\n\nThank you for purchasing and reading!
