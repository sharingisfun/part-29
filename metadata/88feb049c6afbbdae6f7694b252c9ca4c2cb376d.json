Gould's memory capacity was legendary. Both his mental and finger memory made it possible for him to reproduce and play music literature many years after his last practice and performance of the same. A famous illustration of this statement would be an event that occurred in 1970, when the renown Italian pianist, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, was unable to go through with his performance of Beethoven's Concerto No.5, Emperor, in Toronto. Gould was given a telephone call on Thursday evening. The problem was explained, and he was asked to substitute for Michelangeli the next morning, on Friday, when the Toronto Symphony and the conductor, Karel Ancerl, were scheduled to work with Michelangeli. Gould's answer was affirmative and good-spirited. In the space of the next few night hours, Gould rehearsed the Concerto he had not touched in four years. The program was televised and, subsequently, aired on September 12, 1970. To everyone's amazement, Gould played Beethoven's Concerto in front of the camera flawlessly and by heart.\n\n\n================================== Video Info =================================\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Beethoven.Emperor.Concerto.NÃ‚Âº5.E-flat.Glenn.Gould.TSO.Karel.Ancerl.1970.avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 587 MiB\nDuration                                 : 36mn 52s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 227 Kbps\nWriting application                      : MEncoder r33883\nWriting library                          : MPlayer\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : No\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 36mn 52s\nBit rate                                 : 1 999 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nOriginal display aspect ratio            : 5:4\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nStandard                                 : PAL\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.193\nStream size                              : 527 MiB (90%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 63\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 36mn 52s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 215 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 56.7 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 600 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88feb049c6afbbdae6f7694b252c9ca4c2cb376d","amp;dn":"Beethoven.Emperor.Concerto.N%26ordm%3B5.E-flat.Glenn.Gould.TSO.Karel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88feb049c6afbbdae6f7694b252c9ca4c2cb376d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,254,176,73,198,175,187,218,230,247,105,75,37,44,156,164,194,203,55,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
