Strange....\n\nDescription: Applegeeks was largely based around the misadventures of &quot;Hawk,&quot; a somewhat delusional college student with an unnatural fondness for Apple products; his aspiring writer friend, Jayce; and their friends and cohorts. The comic's format shifts between gag-a-day material to spurts of continuity, often dealing with material related to technological accomplishments (with unforeseen results), quasi-romantic unease, or situational comedic moments between the characters. It has currently shifted to a far darker tone with the beginning of the Exodus story arc. As of July 2012, the comic appears to be abandoned, given the lack of updates and statements made in October 2010 by Mohammad and Ananth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd7541f801908a0ac88326f9b77a390f6cdc236c","amp;dn":"Applegeeks+Webcomic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd7541f801908a0ac88326f9b77a390f6cdc236c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,117,65,248,1,144,138,10,200,131,38,249,183,122,57,15,108,220,35,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
