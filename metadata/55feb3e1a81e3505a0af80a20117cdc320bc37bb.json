After his body was found in a shallow grave in the woods two months later, the repercussions were felt for years.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Janet Manning has been haunted by the murder since the day she lost sight of her brother in the park. Now, with the twenty-fifth anniversary of JustinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death looming, a detective and a newspaper reporter have started to ask questions, opening old wounds and raising new suspicions. Could the man convicted of the murderÃ¢â‚¬â€who spent more than two decades in prisonÃ¢â‚¬â€really be innocent? JanetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood friend and high school crush, who was in the park with her that day, has returned to Dove Point, where he is wrestling with his own conflicted memories of the events. And a strange man appears at JanetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s door in the middle of the night, claiming to know the truth. Soon, years of deceit will be swept away, and the truth about what happened to JanetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brother will be revealed. And the answers that Janet has sought may be found much closer to home than she ever could have imagined.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                              Published - October 2nd 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55feb3e1a81e3505a0af80a20117cdc320bc37bb","amp;dn":"The+Hiding+Place+by+David+Bell+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55feb3e1a81e3505a0af80a20117cdc320bc37bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,254,179,225,168,30,53,5,160,175,128,162,1,23,205,195,32,188,55,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
