When you move your body it seems like the creature follows your\nmovement and turns its head, looking at you.\n\nNow you can build one yourself! Print it on paper with your printer, cut it out,\nfold and stick. That is all!\n\nTo make the illusion work: Close one eye, look from a short distance into the\neyes of the creature and rock back and forth. It might take a minute or so\nbefore you see the effect.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1523def613de91ca6d20608cb36a4d1f1c2b8352","amp;dn":"3D+Paper+Optical+Illusions+from+www.urdjuret.com+2011-06-29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1523def613de91ca6d20608cb36a4d1f1c2b8352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,35,222,246,19,222,145,202,109,32,96,140,179,106,77,31,28,43,131,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
