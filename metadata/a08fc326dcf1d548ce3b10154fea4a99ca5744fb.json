I'm thinking that because this movie is heavily influenced by the American style spoofs, that the Russian voters on IMDB took some kind of offence to the comedy style; I personally give it a 7/10.\n\nIf you liked movies like: Naked gun, Spaceballs, Dreamship Suprise Period 1, Wrongfully accused, Batman Teabags The Joker, Top Secret, Hot Shots etc... then you should get into this really weird Russian movie. (FYI - One of the aforementioned movies is not real).\n\nSpoken language is Russian\n\nText language is English (SRT file)\n\nThanks to Scorpion770 for this rip.\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAckIaAgj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAckIaAgj&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nPlease seed for others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a08fc326dcf1d548ce3b10154fea4a99ca5744fb","amp;dn":"Hitler+Is+Kaput%21+%282008%29+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a08fc326dcf1d548ce3b10154fea4a99ca5744fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,143,195,38,220,241,213,72,206,59,16,21,79,234,74,153,202,87,68,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
