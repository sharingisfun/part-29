When not writing erotic romance, she spends her time thinking about writing erotic romance and drinking enough iced coffee to kill a musk ox.\n\nAva yearns for you tragically.

Despite her scattershot creative nature, she's a whiz at organizing, planning, and ordering people around. But her sweet gig turns sour at a charity art auction she's organized when she bumps into a stage lackey and sends a 17th century Qing Dynasty vase crashing to the ground. Electing to take the fall, Sadie attempts to arrange payment of the vase to its owner, eccentric billionaire and (extremely) amateur artist Malcolm Ward. But Malcolm doesn't care about the money or the vase; inspired by Sadie, he decides he only wants her, any way he can have her. In front of his camera, under his brush... or in his bed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5de83fdb8609f03ef357c1e92883f4ee83772af0","amp;dn":"Ava+Lore%2C+The+Billionaire%27s+Muse+series%2C+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5de83fdb8609f03ef357c1e92883f4ee83772af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,232,63,219,134,9,240,62,243,87,193,233,40,131,244,238,131,119,42,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
