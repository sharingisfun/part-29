Edmond O'Brien, Yvonne De Carlo, Richard Arlen\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044036/\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the mining office of Charlie Storrs is robbed by two bandits, his right-hand man Larkin Moffatt gives chase. Larkin catches up to the bandits, but then rides off, never to return. A furious Charlie fires him and spreads the word that Larkin is not a man to be trusted. Later, in the town of Silver City, where he isn't known, Larkin settles down and opens a mining assayer's office. Candace Surrency is pleased when Larkin confirms the value of the ore sample she brought him, but distressed because her dad, Dutch, is leasing the mine and has just 12 days before mineral rights revert to the already rich and wealthy RR Jarboe.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 640x480, 23.976 fps, 1844 Kbps, 01h31m01s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, mono, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5tymbs539/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/t6b0vq9oz/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/51abe0peb/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/lnrvn3ic3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/pvmnvujrn/\r\n\r\ncredit ripper b-------c and source R-, December 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb8f77ba0102cb788e91cfe5a136b416828c1ecd","amp;dn":"Silver+City+%281951+-+USA%29+%5BEdmond+O%27Brien%5D+western","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb8f77ba0102cb788e91cfe5a136b416828c1ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,143,119,186,1,2,203,120,142,145,207,229,161,54,180,22,130,140,30,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
