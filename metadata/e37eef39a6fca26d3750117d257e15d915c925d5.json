After the birth of her daughter, Maddie, Kate put her twenties on hold. Now working as a bar manager to make ends meet and maximize her time with five-year-old Maddie, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uber-prepared for every possible catastrophe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ except for the arrival of her older brother, Ben Fox. \n\nNOTE: Surprisingly good, fresh, funny, heartwarming writing and my beloved Lucy Punch (frankly, only reason why I even watched this Pilot).\nUnfortunately, but lucky for me, it is ONLY new comedy so far I even consider as good. Other comedy series look like digesting old stuff over and over again.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e37eef39a6fca26d3750117d257e15d915c925d5","amp;dn":"Ben.and.Kate.S01E01.480p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e37eef39a6fca26d3750117d257e15d915c925d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,126,239,57,166,252,162,109,55,80,17,125,37,126,21,217,21,201,37,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
