He was 30 years old, and after years playing in small clubs and bars, working construction, and driving trucks to pay the bills for his wife and son, his career was finally taking off. A good guitarist with a versatile and comfortable everyman voice, Croce had also developed into a top-notch songwriter, penning songs that were rich in narrative, full of characters, and arranged with memorable melodic hooks, and he knew his way around a ballad, too. Working on-stage with guitarist and pianist Maury Muehleisen, Croce's live shows were comfortable and intimate affairs, with Croce setting up songs with entertaining back-porch monologues, and the concert in Louisiana was a typical one. It was also his last show. Three hours after the concert, Croce, Muehleisen, and crew boarded a light plane bound for the next show of the tour in Austin, Texas. The plane crashed at takeoff, killing all eight aboard, a tremendous tragedy and an immense loss. Amazingly, an audience member at that last show had recorded the whole concert, and done quite well at it -- so well, in fact, that it quite likely came from the soundboard. It shows Croce in fine form, singing hits like &quot;Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)&quot; and &quot;You Don't Mess Around with Jim&quot; along with other tracks from his first two albums and a pair of covers, an arrangement of Robert Burns' bawdy poem &quot;Ball of Kirriemuir&quot; and a fun version of the Coasters' &quot;Shopping for Clothes,&quot; with four casual monologues between songs. It adds up to a nice portrait of a singular songwriter, singer, and performer, and because it was his actual last performance, it takes on even greater archival importance. This same set was initially issued seven years after Croce's death in 1980, and has been reissued several times since on various labels, including Saja, Castle Music, Essential Records, and Edison. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b12a5e7561d647681b6b5662217036508ba1b3e","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+++%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Jim+Croce+Live%3A+The+Final+Tour++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b12a5e7561d647681b6b5662217036508ba1b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,18,165,231,86,29,100,118,129,182,181,102,34,23,3,101,8,186,27,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
