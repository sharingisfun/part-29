Other highlights include a fan running onstage during &quot;Loving Cup&quot; and being tackled by stage manager Pete Carini, all of which is reported during &quot;Run Like an Antelope&quot; by guitarist Trey Anastasio, who then rightfully begins the encore with a version of &quot;Carini&quot;.\n\nBonus tracks include various soundcheck excerpts from the &quot;Island Tour&quot;\n\n\nDisc one\n&quot;Mike's Song&quot; (Gordon) - 14:19\n&quot;The Old Home Place&quot; (Jayne, Webb) - 3:41\n&quot;Weekapaug Groove&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, McConnell) - 16:27\n&quot;Train Song&quot; (Gordon, Linitz) - 2:59\n&quot;Billy Breathes&quot; (Anastasio) - 7:38\n&quot;Beauty of My Dreams&quot; (McCoury) - 2:41\n&quot;Dogs Stole Things&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 5:00\n&quot;Reba&quot; (Anastasio) - 16:41\n&quot;My Soul&quot; (Chenier) - 8:27\n\nDisc two\n&quot;Roses Are Free&quot; (Freeman, Melchiondo) - 5:33\n&quot;Nassau Jam&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, McConnell) - 21:56\n&quot;Piper&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 16:13\n&quot;Loving Cup&quot; (Jagger, Richards) - 6:53\n&quot;Run Like an Antelope&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall, Pollak) - 14:43\n\nDisc three\nTracks 4-6 were recorded on April 2, 1998 at Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY.

A fan ran up on the stage during Loving Cup, prompting banter and subsequent singing of &quot;Carini's gonna getcha&quot; several times in the Antelope intro, as well as a Carini mention later in the song.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a00af64d75592c615720af6ac449f37c5deef461","amp;dn":"Phish+-+1998-04-03+Nassau+Coliseum+%28Archival+Release%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+r","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a00af64d75592c615720af6ac449f37c5deef461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,10,246,77,117,89,44,97,87,32,175,106,196,73,243,124,93,238,244,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
