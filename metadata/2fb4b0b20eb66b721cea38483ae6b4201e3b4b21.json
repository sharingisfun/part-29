Taller suffered from high cholesterol and his weight got up to 265 pounds at one point. A doctor that was researching his cholesterol suggested that Dr. Taller incorporate safflower oil to lower his cholesterol. Once this was incorporated, Dr. Taller lost 65 pounds in eight months while consuming 5,000 calories per day.\n\nThis led to Taller putting all his information into book form for those that wanted to lose weight. The diet, The Calories Don't Count, involves no calorie counting and the total avoidance of carbohydrates. Foods high in fat and protein were allowed while sugars, cookies, cakes, alcohol, bread, high carbohydrate fruits and juices were to be avoided.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fb4b0b20eb66b721cea38483ae6b4201e3b4b21","amp;dn":"Calories+Don%27t+Count+by+Taller+%281961%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fb4b0b20eb66b721cea38483ae6b4201e3b4b21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,180,176,178,14,182,107,114,28,234,56,72,58,230,180,32,30,59,75,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
