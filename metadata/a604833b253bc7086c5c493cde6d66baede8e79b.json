It can take more time than you can afford to go back and forth on a few logo design concepts while trying to figure out the right logo to match your look. This back and forth can also limit the number of logo design concepts that you get to see, providing ample opportunity to miss out on alternative logo designs that might hit your concept dead on. After you have chosen a logo design concept, changing your look (or adding additional brands to match your business identity) will cost extra to redesign. Why bother with all this wasted time and added cost when you can easily design your own logos?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a604833b253bc7086c5c493cde6d66baede8e79b","amp;dn":"Summitsoft.Logo.Design.Studio.v3.5_kribz.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a604833b253bc7086c5c493cde6d66baede8e79b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,4,131,59,37,59,199,8,108,92,73,60,222,109,102,186,237,232,231,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
