There isn't much added story, character development, or fancy plot twists - all that would just take away time you could be blowing stuff up! Mow down wave after wave of enemies in four games' worth of deliciously chaotic FPS action: Serious Sam: The First Encounter, Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, Serious Sam: BFE (plus Jewel of the Nile content pack), and Serious Sam: Double D XXL. Play as the infamous, iron-jawed hero and battle the forces of the alien ruler, Mental, who's unleashed his minions upon Earth. Welcome them to the planet with rocket launchers, chainsaws, flamethrowers, and a general hail of gunfire in classic shooter play that's an all-out action assault.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1aad00b4ba80685f567e20f1b384b8af8dffe5","amp;dn":"The+Serious+Sam+Collection+NTSC%2FU+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1aad00b4ba80685f567e20f1b384b8af8dffe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,26,173,0,180,186,128,104,95,86,126,32,241,179,132,184,175,141,255,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
