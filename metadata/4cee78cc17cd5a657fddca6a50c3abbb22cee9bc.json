The biography was written at the request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN and Time who has written best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.\nBased on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€in addition to interviews with more than one hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleaguesÃ¢â‚¬â€Isaacson was given &quot;unprecedented&quot; access to Jobs's life. Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over its content other than the book's cover, and waived the right to read it before it was published.\n\n\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cee78cc17cd5a657fddca6a50c3abbb22cee9bc","amp;dn":"iSteve%3A+The+Book+od+Jobs_Steve+Jobs_The+Exclusive+Biography.%28Una","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cee78cc17cd5a657fddca6a50c3abbb22cee9bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,238,120,204,23,205,90,101,127,221,202,106,80,195,171,187,34,206,233,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
