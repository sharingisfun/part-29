Thus I can seed this torrent simultaneously with #10909871 which contains the same files identically, but located elsewhere.\n\nThat way I can cumulatively add to this collection as I acquire more episodes and selections from the Jools Holland programs.\n\nAs it stands, the layout for this torrent has, as a part of its overall structure, the directory structure for torrent 10909871. Thankfully the latest additions do not have any extra &quot;Dolby&quot; sub-component, because I finally repaired my system to allow me to play videos with 6 channel Dolby audio on my two speakers without any speed-ups or delays or any other synchronizations problems.\n\nI will not merge the Dolby audio for the preceding torrent's files because then it would be required for you to download all of the files in this torrent in order to complete its download even if you had all of #10909871 (well, it *could* be done, but it would be a pain in the ass).\n\nAs it is now and will remain in torrents to come, the directory structure looks like this:\n\nRoot &lt;--------------------- [This is where you'd normally put your downloads]\n Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬Jools.Holland.Highlights &lt;- [This is the Jools Holland Root folder]\n     Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬Jools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p  &lt;-- [The totality of #10909871]\n     Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬Dolby\n     Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬SE36.E06 &lt;----- [Current SE36 Root. Name will be updated next torrent]\n         Ã¢â€â€š\n         Ã¢â€â€š Macy Gray - Beauty In The World.avi\n         Ã¢â€â€š White Rabbits - They Done Wrong, We Done Wrong.avi\n         .\n         .\n\nThe root for these Jools Holland clips will always be under the &quot;Jools.Holland.Highlights&quot; folder. Hence, if you already have the files from torrent #10909871, then you would move the &quot;Jools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p&quot; folder immediately below &quot;Jools.Holland.Highlights&quot;. Then force a re-check which will succeed given what you already have. The new files (SE36.E06) will download into their appropriate locations.\n\nAs I add more videos under, say the &quot;Season 36&quot; category, then I will rename the folder as appropriate. If you wanted to maintain the structure and not re-download anything, then you'd rename the SE36 folder exactly as indicated in the torrent followed by a forced re-check.\n\nHere are all the tracks I have so far:\n--------------------------------------\n\nFormat:\nSubfolder/Artist - Song Title.avi\n------------------------\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Agnes Obel - Aventine.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Agnes Obel - Words Are Dead.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Aziza Brahim - Julud.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Clean Bandit w Rae Morris - Extraordinary.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Elbow - Charge.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Engelbert Humperdinck w Jools Holland - Please Release Me.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Hurray for the Riff Raff - Blue Ridge Mountain.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Hurray for the Riff Raff - Look Out Mama.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Lucius - Go Home.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Natalie Merchant - Texas.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Neneh Cherry - Blank Project.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Neneh Cherry - Buffalo Stance.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/Sharon Van Etten - I love you but I'm lost.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/St Vincent - Birth In Reverse.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/St Vincent - Digital Witness.avi\nJools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p/St Vincent - Prince Johnny.avi\nSE36.E06/Macy Gray - Beauty In The World.avi\nSE36.E06/Macy Gray - Interview w Jools Holland.avi\nSE36.E06/Macy Gray - Kissed It.avi\nSE36.E06/Macy Gray - Lately.avi\nSE36.E06/White Rabbits - They Done Wrong, We Done Wrong.avi\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nSo as you can see, I've added 4 new tracks and one interview. 3 tracks by Macy Gray (plus an interview with her) and one track from a band (yes a band!) called &quot;White Rabbits&quot;. They performed, I think 3 songs? but I only liked the last one.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n- user101966","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eca790da56eafdd4a9fd856ed4b732c175bd8484","amp;dn":"Jools.Holland.Highlights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eca790da56eafdd4a9fd856ed4b732c175bd8484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,167,144,218,86,234,253,212,169,253,133,110,212,183,50,193,117,189,132,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
