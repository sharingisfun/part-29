Flac/Ape in separate tracks, log, scans, score. Added BBC Radio 4 Soul music series exploring famous pieces of music and their emotional appeal, and 2008 BBC video â€œSacred Music: The Story Of Allegri's Miserereâ€, actor Simon Russell Beale tells the story behind one of the most popular pieces of sacred music ever written. Once decreed by the Pope to be too beautiful to be heard outside the Sistine Chapel, Allegri's Miserere has become one of the best loved and most recognisable pieces of choral music, famous for its soaring high notes. The programme features a full performance of the piece by the award-winning choir The Sixteen conducted by Harry Christophers from LSO St Luke's.
