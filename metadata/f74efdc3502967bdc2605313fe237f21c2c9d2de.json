The Way I Am\n\nAlbum Description\nWhat sticks out about this 12-track effort is that the music is intended to be powerful but subtle most of the time, and not a score that drowns out any of the film's critical scenes. The score was a cooperative composition job between Buck Sanders and music great Marco Beltrami (Hellboy, The Omen, Terminator 3). The duo worked together on a variety of films in the past, and their chemistry shows in their musical work for this movie.\n\nBeltrami was obviously going for a modern day Cowboy flick feel when composing some of the music, to reflect the dangerous backdrop of the film (no surprise considering his past work with Sanders including 3:10 to Yuma). Most of the score is dark and foreboding, with unconventional instrumentation that create a sense of tension. Don't expect an orchestral performance like in Glory; the duo keep instruments to a minimum, but with maximum effect.\n\nThe film itself has very little music weaved in (about 30 minutes), and some of the songs from the film won't be found on the CD. A good example of this is &quot;Khyber Pass&quot; by Ministry, a full-throttle metal track that matches the adrenaline-pumping action of the film. As an added head's up, there were also two other Ministry songs, Fear and Palestina, that you won't find on this CD.\n\nThe album is only a half-hour long, but this fairly dark work more than delivers if you're a fan of movie scores.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f74efdc3502967bdc2605313fe237f21c2c9d2de","amp;dn":"Marco+Beltrami+%26+Buck+Sanders+-+The+Hurt+Locker+%5BOST%5D%282009%29%5BSoun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f74efdc3502967bdc2605313fe237f21c2c9d2de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,78,253,195,80,41,103,189,194,96,83,19,254,35,127,33,194,201,210,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
