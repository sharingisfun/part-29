From the downbeat, they knew exactly what they wanted to achieve with this project. Their goals were to create great music, develop a unique image, forge credible industry contacts, and build a loyal nationwide fan base. They were well aware that the combination of these elements would help lead them to undeniable success in the music industry. This work ethic and commitment has since opened many doors for the band.
