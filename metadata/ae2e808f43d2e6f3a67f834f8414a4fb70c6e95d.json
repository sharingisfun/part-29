Previous to Arcane, Adam Doll, Craig McKeown, John Fulton, and Chris Pennie played together in the bands Samsara and Malfactor from 1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1997. Managed by longtime friend Tom Apostolopoulos and guitarist Ben Weinman, Arcane recorded a self-titled demo under the name The Dillinger Escape Plan, in reference to the early 1930s bank robber John Dillinger, famous for his multiple escapes from jail. Now or Never Records offered to release the demo. The six-track EP was released in 1997 by Now or Never Records, and set them off on a small club tour around northeast America. Shortly before their first tour under the new name, guitarist Derek Brantley left the group and was replaced by John Fulton.\n\nDuring this time period, The Dillinger Escape Plan gained notoriety in the hardcore punk scene for the intensity of their performances. Their performances were increasingly wild, and often violent. These elaborate performances, as well as the creative, technical approach of their music led a record executive of Relapse Records to offer the band a multi-record contract. The band agreed to the contract, and recorded their second EP with Relapse entitled Under the Running Board. Shortly after its release, Fulton left the band over creative differences. Thats just what I used google them for more if interested.
