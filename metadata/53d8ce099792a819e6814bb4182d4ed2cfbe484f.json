It's a nice little flick ;)\n\n\nCodec: h.264 (MKV)\nLanguage: English\nResolution: 720x480\nAudio: AC3\n\n================================================================================\n================================================================================\n\nYear of Production: 2003\nCountry: USA\nWriters:John Perry, Jerry Rapp\nDirector: Christopher Shelton\nCast:\nMarley Shelton ...  Melissa Kennard \nSamantha Shelton ... Emily Manning \nMisha Collins ... Tony Derrick \nMark Pellegrino ...  Alan Kennard \nLeslie Jordan ...  Arthur \n\n\n================================================================================\n================================================================================\n\nThe story follows the two sisters Melissa and Emily, the former who accidentally killed her husband Alan and the latter who agrees to help her bury her husband in the desert. While there, they encounter a trucker who hates his dogs and takes a special dislike to the sisters, a Park Ranger who takes a shine to Melissa and finally a strange, homeless man who thinks he is in a soap opera. While Melissa and Emily try their best to find a suitable place to bury Alan, much of their history is revealed and the day in the desert has a great impact on their lives.\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n================================================================================\n\n\nI suggest using VLC for playing it, or any media player that can play mkv files.\n\nA few notes: I have a VERY slow broadband and thus this file will take approximately... 10-12 hours for me to upload completely, so DON'T cry about slow speed, because I know, ok? I know. \nFor those that stick with it, please, please, please seed for a few days! I'll seed as long as there is interest, but you guys are just as important.\nLast, but not least: I urge you to BUY the movie if you like it - you can only get this DVD in Brazil so you'll have to visit some site, like cdpoint.com.br or something to order it, and yes, it has dual-audio so you won't have to watch the dub unless you want to, but make sure it says so in the description. \n\n\n\n\nP.S. My first torrent =D\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53d8ce099792a819e6814bb4182d4ed2cfbe484f","amp;dn":"Moving+Alan+%282003+DVDRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53d8ce099792a819e6814bb4182d4ed2cfbe484f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,216,206,9,151,146,168,25,230,129,75,180,24,45,78,210,207,190,72,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
