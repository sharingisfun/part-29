And it was sheer          \n           greed that made Prem try to pull a fast one over her           \n           father. As for sweet and simple Jenny, brought up by           \n           indifferent and uncaring parents, all she longed was to        \n           love and be loved in return.                                   \n                                                                          \n           And it was love and only love for Jenny that made Prem         \n           turn over a new leaf. From hardly working vagabond Prem        \n           began working hard to make money... From a besotted            \n           Romeo, he becomes a mature and thoughtful Majnu who put        \n           Jenny's happiness above everything else...As for               \n           Jenny...she loves Rahul (Upen Patel). That's when she          \n           realises that she had made a mistake with realizing who        \n           she really loves.                                              \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Mithilesh Chaturvedi....... : ..................Mr. Pinto      \n           Zakir Hussain.............. : ......................Sajid      \n           Jagdeep.................... : .....................Rustom      \n           Darshan Jariwala........... : ........Shiv Shankar Sharma      \n           Smita Jaykar............... : .............Shalini Sharma      \n           Katrina Kaif............... : ......................Jenny      \n           Salman Khan................ : Special Appearance as Himse      \n           Govind Namdeo.............. : ............Pitambar Jalaan      \n           Navneet Nishan............. : .................Mrs. Pinto      \n           Lalit Parashar............. : .............Pet Shop Owner      \n           Upen Patel................. : ......................Rahul      \n           Akul Tripathi.............. : ..............Kunnan Thambi      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                                    Enjoy!                                  \n                                                                            \n                                                                        \n                       \n                          \n                  \n             \n                                                                        \n              VoMiT is now looking for:                                     \n                                                                            \n               1.50mbit+ EU dump site for release spreading.                \n               2.100mbit+ affil sites for XviD/DVDR.                        \n               3.10mbit+ 100GB dumps for personal group use.                \n               4.US/EU pre DVD suppliers.                                   \n                                                                            \n              If u can help us with any of those, contact us at:            \n                                                                            \n                                &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;addbc2c0c4d9edc5d8dec583ccc4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;                               \n                                                                            \n                              Have a nice day :P                            \n                                                                            \n                        \n                               \n                          \n             \n                                                                        \n                    JFKDVD DiAMOND JUMANJi HNRDVD FRAGMENT                  \n                                                                            \n                    DoNE DVDR DPiMP SAPHiRE HNR CME WRD HLS                 \n                                                                            \n                   HAGGiS IGUANA iMBT CLUE FiCO VH-PROD TNAN                \n                                                                            \n                                                          \n  \n   Have you hugged your toilet today?
