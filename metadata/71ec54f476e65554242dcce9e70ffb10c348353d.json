Here, he meets a very young Isabella Rossellini (in her first feature film) as a meek Russian housewife, and is reunited with his old colleague, Helen Mirren. A breathtaking tale from the Cold War with lots of amazing, energetic dancing and a fantastic, forbidden crash landing with a 747. (&quot;Will the person who spoke English please come back on the radio?&quot;)\n\nGood stereo sound, was finally released on dvd last year. 136 min. with good quality. Burn tested, runs well in my divX player.\n\nFor the musically inclined: The opening sequence (where Baryshnikov seems to defy gravity) is a dramatization using Bach's Great Passacagglia in C minor, originally composed for church organ, here re-arranged for a symphony orchestra. \n\nWith English subs whenever Russian is spoken. \nI bought this dvd some months ago and ripped it, only to find that someone had beat me to uploading a similar rip without introducing it properly here on PirateBay. So I try and hope it works.\n\nThe DVD with Nordic subs is available from Cdon.com &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090319/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090319/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ec54f476e65554242dcce9e70ffb10c348353d","amp;dn":"White+Nights+%5B1985%5D+DVDRIP+%28Baryshnikov_Rossellini_Mirren%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ec54f476e65554242dcce9e70ffb10c348353d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,236,84,244,118,230,85,84,36,45,204,233,231,15,251,16,195,72,53,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
