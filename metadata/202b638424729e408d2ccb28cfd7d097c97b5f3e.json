The subsequent chapters review the research\n in each of the four categories along the continuum, covering topics such as the intensive spatial, \ntemporal, and thermal sensitivity of the hand, the role of hand movements in recognizing common objects,\n the control of reaching and grasping movements, and the organization of keyboard skills. Jones and \nLederman also examine how sensory and motor function develops in the hand from birth to old age, and\n how the nature of the end effector (e.g., a single finger or the whole hand) that is used to interact\n with the environment influences the types of information obtained and the tasks performed. The book\n closes with an assessment of how basic research on the hand has contributed to an array of more applied\n domains, including communication systems for the blind, haptic interfaces used in teleoperation and\n virtual-environment applications, tests used to assess hand impairments, and haptic exploration in\n art. Human Hand Function will be a valuable resource for student and professional researchers in\n neuroscience, cognitive psychology, engineering, human-technology interaction, and physiology......\n.........................\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:202b638424729e408d2ccb28cfd7d097c97b5f3e","amp;dn":"Human+Hand+Function-MANTESH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"202b638424729e408d2ccb28cfd7d097c97b5f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,43,99,132,36,114,158,64,141,44,203,40,207,215,208,151,201,123,95,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
