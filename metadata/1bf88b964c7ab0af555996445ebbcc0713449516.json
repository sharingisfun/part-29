In 1642 both Royalists and Parliamentarians expected that one great contest of arms would see the crushing of their enemies. When their field armies blundered into contact on the evening of 22 October 1642, Prince Rupert urged King Charles to array his army on the great ridge of Edgehill and give battle. The next day, amidst abject cowardice and absolute courage, the tide of battle swept Rupert's cavalry to triumph, but saw victory snatched away as the Royalist infantry was hurled back by the defiant Parliamentarians. The chance for decisive victory was lost and the bloody civil war raged on. This first-ever English Civil War campaign title from Osprey uncovers remarkable new evidence to transform the accepted view of this key battle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf88b964c7ab0af555996445ebbcc0713449516","amp;dn":"Edgehill+1642%3A+The+First+Battle+of+the+English+Civil+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf88b964c7ab0af555996445ebbcc0713449516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,248,139,150,76,122,176,175,85,89,150,68,94,187,204,7,19,68,149,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
