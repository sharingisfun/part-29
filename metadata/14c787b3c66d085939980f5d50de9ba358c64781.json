Mostly behind-the-scenes footage and off-the-cuff comments from the crew (don't ever work on a KISS tour seems to be a common comment). Shows how much work is actually done on a  show but also shows that the crew has some time to relax and that part of the time it's just mind-numbingly boring. Also contains live footage shot from the mixing board using a tripod, some footage of Anthrax shot from the side of the stage, comments on Gene's arrest, and a wedding. Grainy and blurry, probably a 3rd generation VHS transfer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c787b3c66d085939980f5d50de9ba358c64781","amp;dn":"KISS+-+the+Roadie+tapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c787b3c66d085939980f5d50de9ba358c64781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,199,135,179,198,109,8,89,57,152,15,93,80,222,155,163,88,198,71,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
