This file should be downloaded by default to your SD card, though you can select the folder where the file is on the preferences menu. Alternativly we can use your Internet connection instead of the dictionary. This option can be activated in the settings menu. It also can calculate natively the key although it will take about 2 minutes in less powerfull phones and about 10 seconds on a Samsung Galaxy S. This tool also detects the new 2010 Thomson routers for which keys cannot yet be generated. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a289b088b75429b7af2aad4b00d0f33ab2725a","amp;dn":"RouterKeyGen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a289b088b75429b7af2aad4b00d0f33ab2725a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,162,137,176,136,183,84,41,183,175,42,173,75,0,208,243,58,178,114,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
