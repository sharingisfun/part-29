Particularly in an extended version of discarded Isness track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes My BrotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (confusingly titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe ProphetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ here, with another track called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes My BrotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), it features more of a funk and blues influence than The Isness, alongside the aforementioned electronic sections.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04ab6fb874e9dfa6f1a009e3ea636bc056359806","amp;dn":"Amorphous+Androgynous+%28FSOL%29+-+Alice+in+Ultraland+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04ab6fb874e9dfa6f1a009e3ea636bc056359806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,171,111,184,116,233,223,166,241,160,9,227,234,99,107,192,86,53,152,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
