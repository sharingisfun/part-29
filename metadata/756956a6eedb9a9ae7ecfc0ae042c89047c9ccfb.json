You want answers? Here they are. You may NOT like what is coming for USa.\n\nDescription:\n\nMany people are becoming increasingly conscious that we are entering a unique phase of human history. Some are terrified. Some are predicting cosmic doom on the near horizon. Others are making astonishing predictions. What does the Bible really say?\n\nEschatology (the Study of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last ThingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) is among the most challenging avenues of study, even for the most sophisticated.\n\n   What are the Ã¢â‚¬Å“realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ End Time events?\n   What is the most preposterous doctrine in Christianity?\n   Does the Church go through the Great Tribulation?\n   Which Kingdom do we pray for in the LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prayer?\n   Is there really a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Battle of ArmageddonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Why?\n   What Scripture did Jesus deliberately leave out in Nazareth?\n   Who is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“AntiChristÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Is he alive today?\n   Should we expect a literal Babylon on the horizon?\n\nJoin Dr. Chuck Missler in the Executive Briefi\u001fng Room of The River Lodge, in New Zealand, for an intensive summary of the entire fabric of controversies and insights in this most provocative area.\n\nÃ‚Â© 2012 Koinonia House Inc.\n\nThis briefing pack collection contains 6 hours of teaching\n\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:756956a6eedb9a9ae7ecfc0ae042c89047c9ccfb","amp;dn":"POtHS+2+-+Bible+Study+-+Part+98+-+The+End+Times+Scenario+-+2012+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"756956a6eedb9a9ae7ecfc0ae042c89047c9ccfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,105,86,166,238,219,154,154,231,236,252,10,224,66,200,144,71,201,204,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
