This album is required at the time as relatively novel in view of the contents of certain texts (SF-oriented mode is when the occult and gore), but especially his artwork signed by the famous designer Philippe 70s Druillet ( &quot;The Adventures of Lone Sloane,&quot; &quot;The Night&quot; ...). The album received a very warm welcome by its international mix pretty original (for time) Thrash brutal and technical Death (type there yet), which propelled him to the forefront.\n\n2 years later, when it was released in 1992, &quot;Towards Beyond&quot; is the result of a huge stir. Recorded in Sweden at Montezuma Studio produced by The Boss himself (Bathory) and released on Black Mark Prod. He mixes medieval and quite technical Death, Thrash riffs and ultra-heavy passages with a hollow sound, the album immediately stands out as one of the best surprises Death of a 1992 vintage, however strong, but especially as the best album released by a French group that year.\n\nThe face of Agressor Split LP &quot;Licensed to Thrash&quot; was republished in 1993 by Black Mark Prod. MCD in the name of &quot;Satan Sodomy&quot;\n\nIn &quot;Symposium of Rebirth&quot; in 1994, Agressor continues to follow their style while remaining true to their roots while exploring new ground with the Choir of the OpÃƒÂ©ra de Lyon, which were incurred for the registration and with the participation of Barney Greenway of Napalm Death vocalist on a cover of Terrorizer. The album alternates with medieval acoustic tracks of pure brutal Death of opera choruses on blast-beats, resumption of film music and tech hallucinating at the time.\n\nThe group goes on tour and concerts with bands such as Sinister, Wargasm, Morbid Angel, Obituary, Pestilence and Biohazard.\n\nAfter their tour of Britain with Cradle Of Filth in June 96, Alex began working for Black Mark Prod and became guitarist for Ibanez.\n\nBecause of all these activities, Agressor not return in 2000 with &quot;Medieval Rites&quot;, recorded with the participation of many different musicians, a flutist, a violinist, trumpeters, an opera singer, most other people Metal scene: Krell and Christina (Bloodthorn), Morten Nielsen (former drummer of Mercyful Fate), Kai Hahto (Rotten Sound, Enochian Crescent).\n\nWill follow a tour with Bloodthorn, ... and Oceans and the MCD &quot;The Spirit of Evil&quot; also contains a range Roma with two videos recorded in Marseilles in 2000 at a concert with Mayhem and participation of James Murphy of Testament / Death ...\n\nIn January 2002, the group organizes an anniversary concert at Midem in Cannes where the video was released in 2006 on a DVD accompanying the new album &quot;Deathreat&quot; from Season of Mist.
