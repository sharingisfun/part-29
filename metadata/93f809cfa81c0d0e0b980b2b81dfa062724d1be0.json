Or, if wormholes could make time travel a reality? And could life on Earth survive a huge meteor strike like the one that took out the dinosaurs? From the Big Bang to the possibility of alien life and deep space travel, scientists expand our understanding of the universe. This series combines the most current scientific information, cutting-edge computer graphics, dramatic time-lapse sequences and everyday examples to shed light on some of the most mind-boggling aspects of our universe.\n\nSizing Up The Universe \nIn the known universe, size matters. From the enormity of the galaxy, to the tiny atoms that are the building blocks of everything, the universe is a place of extreme sizes. From the unimaginably big to the incomprehensibly small, explore size in the universe and exactly what it means to us and our understanding of the cosmos.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 46mn 58s 752ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : Englsih UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Science/Nature\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 248 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 384 (1.625) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 122 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f809cfa81c0d0e0b980b2b81dfa062724d1be0","amp;dn":"National+Geographic-The+Known+Universe+%282009%29+20f3.WS-PDTV.XviD.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f809cfa81c0d0e0b980b2b81dfa062724d1be0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,248,9,207,168,28,13,14,11,152,11,43,129,223,160,98,114,77,27,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
