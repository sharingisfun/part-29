You will not get professional quality panoramas such as those seen here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://panoramas.dk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://panoramas.dk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhat you will get is fast results from typical consumer digital camera images. The software is about is automatic as is possible with good manual overrides available. You supply the images, tell the software what focal length of lens was used, arrange the pictures in the order you want them stitched, and tell the software what kind of output you want. Press a few buttons and bingo, there&amp;#039;s your panorama. You can review and correct the stitching decisions on a stitch by stitch basis before final file output.\n\nFiguring out the 35mm equivalent of your camera&amp;#039;s focal length can be a bit tricky. You need your camera lens specifications, the ability to read the EXIF data on your images, and mathematics skills to make the conversion. Once you figure this out you can enter and save the focal length data in PhotoStitch for future panos.\n\n\n---\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n1. Install desired language version.\n2. Update the program with PST3119UPD_EN.exe\n\nimpact0r","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5a1c9c972256c514a12a6afc490d844b77c60ab","amp;dn":"Canon+PhotoStich+3.1+-+impact0r","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5a1c9c972256c514a12a6afc490d844b77c60ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,161,201,201,114,37,108,81,74,18,166,175,196,144,216,68,183,124,96,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
