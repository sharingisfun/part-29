Numerous introductory books have appeared in recent years to cater to this growing interest, \nbut almost none devotes attention to the specifically ethical dimensions of the tradition. For various complex cultural and historical reasons, ethics has not received as much attention in traditional Buddhist thought as it has in the West. \nWritten by Damien Keown, one of the few experts worldwide who specializes in the area, Buddhist Ethics illustrates how Buddhism might approach a range of contemporary moral issues, \nranging from abortion to euthanasia, sexuality to cloning, and even war and economics.\nAbout the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. \nWritten by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, \nfrom philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e09add6447692cc0f76007e4821abc52d2f25296","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Ethics-+A+Very+Short+Introduction%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e09add6447692cc0f76007e4821abc52d2f25296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,154,221,100,71,105,44,192,247,96,7,228,130,26,188,82,210,242,82,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
