At nearly 72, he shows no signs of\nslowing down, as evidenced by Occupy the World, a two-disc package recorded\nwith the 20-piece Nordic ensemble TUMO which features among its ranks trumpeter\nVerneri Pohjola, flutist Juhani Aaltone, harpist Iro Haarla, saxophonist\nFrederik Ljungqvist, and drummer Stefan Pasborg. There are numerous winds,\nstrings, electric guitars, vibes, electronics, accordion, brass, piano, and\ndrums. There are five new compositions on offer here, the shortest of which is\njust under 16 minutes. These new pieces extend out from Smith's composing\nsystem that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use transposition of any instrument's natural key; he uses\nthe entire C spectrum as his base. What this means is that there are sections\nwritten with carefully designed passages that use an instrument's natural voice\nand harmonics. His system is also non-metric; it uses proportional\nrelationships to guide the music along his envisioned horizontal flow. In\naddition to built-in dynamic tensions, widely varying textural elements, and\nelaborate harmonic constructions, there is considerable freedom built in for\nplayers to interact with one another all along his tonal range with varying\ntempi. While this creates an organic dissonance, it also creates almost\nlimitless possibilities. &quot;Mount Kilimanjaro (Love and Compassion for John\nLindberg)&quot; is a concerto written for and featuring the double bassist as prime\nsoloist backed by three drummers. It is a tribute to his instincts as an\nimproviser, attendant listener, and anchor in many of Smith's ensembles over\nthe last 35 years, and is one of the three real treasures here. Disc two\ncontains two truly major new works: &quot;Crossing on a Southern Road (A Memorial\nfor Marion Brown),&quot; an expansive, colorful, yet brooding work that involves\nmultiple ensembles covering various tonal ranges and contains one of Smith's\nmost moving trumpeter solos on record, and &quot;Occupy the World for Life, Liberty,\nand Justice,&quot; which had its debut performance in 2011 and has been\nsubstantially revised since for performance with this large group. Over\nhalf-an-hour, this ambitious work ranges from detailed notated sections where\nvarious units interact with others, sometimes slowly, spaciously, and\ndeliberately, creating tensions that result in cacophonous, colorful, and\nwildly energetic interplay. It simultaneously celebrates the energy commitment\nand diversity of the Occupy movement, as well as depicting its sometimes tense\nencounters with police, government, and media. The handsome booklet that\naccompanies this package contains detailed notes by Smith, photos, as well as\nbiographies of all the musicians. Occupy the World is a demanding listening\nexperience -- we'd expect nothing less from a composer of Smith's mettle -- but\nits rewards are abundant for both fans of vanguard jazz and modern\ncomposition.\n\n--\n\nBy Stef &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2013/09/wadada-leo-smith-tumo-occupy-world-tum.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2013/09/wadada-leo-smith-tumo-occupy-world-tum.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Hrayr Attarian &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/occupy-the-world-wadada-leo-smith-tum-records-review-by-hrayr-attarian.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/occupy-the-world-wadada-leo-smith-tum-records-review-by-hrayr-attarian.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy John Sharpe &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/occupy-the-world-wadada-leo-smith-tum-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/occupy-the-world-wadada-leo-smith-tum-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Eyal Hareuveni &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/wadada-leo-smith-occupy-the-world-by-eyal-hareuveni.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/wadada-leo-smith-occupy-the-world-by-eyal-hareuveni.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy David Whiteis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/107938-occupy-the-world-wadada-leo-smith-tumo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/107938-occupy-the-world-wadada-leo-smith-tumo&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26bcb3de6d09cf00b8ef7dbe810fc1ea5d79a002","amp;dn":"Wadada+Leo+Smith+%26amp%3B+TUMO+-+Occupy+The+World+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26bcb3de6d09cf00b8ef7dbe810fc1ea5d79a002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,188,179,222,109,9,207,0,184,239,125,190,129,15,193,234,93,121,160,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
