To create a great game you need passion, imagination, talent, a good understanding of game-play and design, experience, a dedicated team, good project management and lots of hard work. Every game developed is individual, but there are certain techniques and fundamentals that can be learnt to understand the creative process of game design, and those fundamentals will be discussed throughout this book.   Covering the process of game design, the book builds up a set of techniques used by designers within the industry. It will show and tell, explaining how and why things are done the way they are, and will feature first-hand experiences, examples and case studies from the creators of successful games such as Ã‚Â¿Lara Croft/Tomb RaiderÃ‚Â¿ and Peter MolyneuxÃ‚Â¿s Ã‚Â¿Black and WhiteÃ‚Â¿. Throughout the book an imaginary game &quot;Jumping Jack&quot; will be discussed, taking the reader through the process of developing a design from the initial idea through to the full-blown specification. Demonstration levels and the design documents will be included on the accompanying CD, and these documents can be used as templates for future designs. The book is divided into two parts. The first, Design DNA, discusses the components that make up a game design. The second part, Building the Design, describes the process of creating and formatting design documents. Using case studies and examples, the elements that create fun and absorbing game-play will be revealed. The book covers the range of major consoles such as PS2, Nintendo Gamecube, Xbox, Gameboy Advance and the PC, providing an insight into the different considerations a designer must be aware of for different platforms and producing cross-platform games.\n\nAuthor: Kevin Oxland | Publication Date: June 3, 2004 | Pages: 368 | Format: PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91924992f973b2c4f22ce8f4f3f1ac32af574d50","amp;dn":"Gameplay+and+Design+-+%5BK-23%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91924992f973b2c4f22ce8f4f3f1ac32af574d50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,146,73,146,249,115,178,196,242,44,232,244,243,241,172,50,175,87,77,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
