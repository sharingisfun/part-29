In an attempt to duplicate the success of his hit, Dolan recorded talking blues songs and novelties for Capitol through the mid-'50s, sometimes approximating Ernest Tubb's vocal style or following in the footsteps of Tex Williams (&quot;Nicotine Fits&quot;). The novelties tend to be the standout tracks on this 31-song import, since the talking blues numbers are a little monochromatic and the ballads are compromised by Dolan's unremarkable vocals. Interesting selections such as &quot;Tool Pusher on a Rotary Rig&quot; and a trio of sea-faring songs including the excellent &quot;Jolly Captain Huddlestead&quot; are highlights, as is a 1955 version of the Cheers' hit &quot;Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots.&quot; ~ Greg Adams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b58bbb17cf5415f9e138915500ab81947953fed","amp;dn":"Jimmie+Dolan+-+Juke+Box+Boogie+-+Bear+Family+CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b58bbb17cf5415f9e138915500ab81947953fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,88,187,177,124,245,65,95,158,19,137,21,80,10,184,25,71,149,63,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
