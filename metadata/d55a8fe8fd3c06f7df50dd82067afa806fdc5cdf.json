Nihilist prophets, born-again pornographers, transcendental schizophrenics and just plain folks are united in their belief in an imminent global catastrophe. What are the forces lurking behind this mass delirium?\r\n\r\nAPOCALYPSE CULTURE is a startling, absorbing and exhaustive tour through the nether regions of todayâ€™s psychotic brainscape.\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1987, APOCALYPSE CULTURE immediately touched a nerve. Alternately excoriated and lauded as â€œepochalâ€, â€œthe most important book of the decade,â€ APOCALYPSE CULTURE had begun to articulate what many inwardly sensed â€” the-fear inspired irrationalism and faith, the clash of irreconcilable forces, and the ever-looming specter of fin de race.\r\n\r\nREVIEWS:\r\n\r\n&quot;Parfrey has edited a new book of Revelation, a collection which is almost as awesome and terrifying as the original biblical text.&quot;\r\n--Edwin Pouncey, NME\r\n\r\n&quot;Apocalypse Culture is compulsory reading for all those concerned with the crisis of our times. An extraordinary collection unlike anything I have ever encountered. These are the terminal documents of the twentieth century.&quot;\r\n--J.G. Ballard\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\r\n\r\nSince his influential collection, Apocalypse Culture, was first released in 1987, the award-winning writer Adam Parfrey has been credited for discovering and revealing the inner workings of cults and unusual pop culture histories.\r\n\r\nDETAILS:\r\n\r\n272 pages\r\nPublisher: Amok Press; First edition (1987)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0941693023\r\nISBN-13: 978-0941693028","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55a8fe8fd3c06f7df50dd82067afa806fdc5cdf","amp;dn":"Apocalypse+Culture+%281987%29+edited+by+Adam+Parfrey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55a8fe8fd3c06f7df50dd82067afa806fdc5cdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,90,143,232,253,60,6,247,223,80,221,130,6,122,250,128,111,220,92,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
