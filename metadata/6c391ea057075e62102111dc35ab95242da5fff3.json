Some say it is a bridge to something sinister; the counter indicating the number of people who have died after visiting the page. It is said that people who have visited the site and witness a certain event are drawn into a mysterious space compiled of the memories of the dead - the space between life and death. Someone or something is drawing the living there for a reason, and it is up to the player to discover the horrifying truth. In order to do so, players will use various equipment including flash lights, phones, and other items to navigate and escape the Calling.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gametdb.com/Wii/SCAE18&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gametdb.com/Wii/SCAE18&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nID.................SCAE18\nregion.............NTSC-U\ntype...............Wii\nlanguages..........EN\ndeveloper..........Hudson Soft\npublisher..........Hudson Soft\nrelease date.......2010-3-9\ngenre..............action, adventure, survival horror\nrating.............T\ncontent............violence\nplayers............1\nreq. accessories...wiimote, nunchuk\n\n\n          Most of my 1500+ Wii games are listed here (not all yet).\n        \n                            parts 1 and 2   \n                   &lt;a href=&quot; http://textuploader.com/koes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://textuploader.com/koes&lt;/a&gt;   \n                   &lt;a href=&quot; http://textuploader.com/oneu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://textuploader.com/oneu&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck it out and see if there's a game you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to \n\nhelp out.\n\nIf you happen to have a game I do not, please upload it and let me know...Thanx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c391ea057075e62102111dc35ab95242da5fff3","amp;dn":"Calling+%5BSCAE18%5D+%28wbfs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c391ea057075e62102111dc35ab95242da5fff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,57,30,160,87,7,94,98,16,33,17,220,53,171,149,36,45,165,255,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
