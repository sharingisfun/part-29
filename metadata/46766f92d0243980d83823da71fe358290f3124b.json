Problems on Statistical Mechanics provides over 120 problems with model solutions, illustrating both basic principles and applications that range from solid-state physics to cosmology. An introductory chapter provides a summary of the basic concepts and results that are needed to tackle the problems, and also serves to establish the notation that is used throughout the book. The problems themselves occupy five chapters, progressing from the simpler aspects of thermodynamics and equilibrium statistical ensembles to the more challenging ideas associated with strongly interacting systems and nonequilibrium processes. Comprehensive solutions to all of the problems are designed to illustrate efficient and elegant problem-solving techniques. Where appropriate, the authors incorporate extended discussions of the points of principle that arise in the course of the solutions. The appendix provides useful mathematical formulae.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46766f92d0243980d83823da71fe358290f3124b","amp;dn":"Problems+on+Statistical+Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46766f92d0243980d83823da71fe358290f3124b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,118,111,146,208,36,57,128,216,56,35,218,113,254,53,130,144,243,18,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
