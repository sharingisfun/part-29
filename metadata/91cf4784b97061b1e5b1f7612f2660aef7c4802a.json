Its music is associated with both psychedelic rock and progressive rock, yet having been influenced by trance, krautrock and ambient due to Steven Wilson and Richard Barbieri's penchant for the Kosmische Musik scene of the early 1970s, led by bands such as Tangerine Dream, Neu! and Can. Since the early 2000s, the music has been leaning towards progressive metal and alternative rock.\nLine-up:\nSteven Wilson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitars, piano, synthesizers\nRichard Barbieri Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, synthesizers, piano\nColin Edwin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, double bass\nChris Maitland Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, backing vocals (1993Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2002)\nGavin Harrison Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums and percussion (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n[from Wikipedia]\n\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.porcupinetree.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.porcupinetree.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck the INFO file for more details about this torrent\nand....\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nKids in the back seat cause accidents.
