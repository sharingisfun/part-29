Going to Ohio State to train under its track and field coach, Larry Snyder, the young African American athlete quickly impresses with his tremendous potential that suggests Olympic material. However, as Owens struggles both with the obligations of his life and the virulent racism against him, the question of whether America would compete at all at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany is being debated vigorously. When American envoy, Avery Brundage, finds a compromise personally persuasive and tolerable enough with the Third Reich to avert a boycott, Owens has his own moral struggle on whether to go. Upon resolving that issue, Owens and his coach travel to Berlin to participate in a competition that would mark Owens as the greatest of the American Olympians even as the German film director, Leni Riefenstahl, locks horns with her country's Propaganda Minister, Josef Goebbels, to film the politically embarrassing fact for posterity.                \r\n\r\nYear: 2016                \r\nDirector: Stephen Hopkins                \r\nWriters: Joe Shrapnel, Anna Waterhouse                \r\nStars: Stephan James, Jason Sudeikis, Eli Goree, Shanice Banton, Carice van Houten, Jeremy Irons, William Hurt, David Kross, Jonathan Higgins, Tony Curran                \r\nGenres: Biography, Drama, Sport                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Race.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 3000  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRUNTIME.....................: 134 min\t         \r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1920x816                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 5.1 Channel / AC3 / 384kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 3.18 GiB / MKV\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/race/2016/race-2016-poster.jpg \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
