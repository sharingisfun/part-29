Rarely endorsed by any political party, the use of collective bodily strength remains a strategy of activists working in alliances and coalitions against fascism. In Physical Resistance famous battles against fascists, from the Olympia arena, Earls Court in 1934 and Cable Street in 1936 to Southall in 1978 and Bradford 2010, are told through the voices of participants. Anarchists, communists and socialists who belonged to a shifting series of anti-fascist organizations relate well-known events alongside many forgotten but significant episodes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06178c672d6822809486aa26629602d314e9b8e8","amp;dn":"Physical+Resistance+A+Hundred+Years+of+Anti-Fascism+By+Dave+Hann","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06178c672d6822809486aa26629602d314e9b8e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,23,140,103,45,104,34,128,148,134,170,38,98,150,2,211,20,233,184,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
