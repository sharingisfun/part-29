Otherwise, you will hear static.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\n\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nTwo of BT's three 2012 releases converted with SPEC on one DVD here. The first is a bit more in line with his excellent &quot;This Binary Universe&quot; while the other crosses into deep ambient, almost even contemporary classical, territory. I've been quite BT-obsessed as of late and, while these aren't his biggest releases, I hope they find some homes.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n13 Angels On My Broken Windowsill\nGo(d)t\nHymn [808]\nSeven-Hundred-Thirty-Nine\nHikari\nOur Dark Garden\nThe Gathering Darkness\nMorceau Subrosa\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1f8bd6669af4758bfc2b6ff9667c99920054401","amp;dn":"BT+-+If+the+Stars+are+Eternal+So+Are+You+%26amp%3B+I%2FMorceau+Subrosa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1f8bd6669af4758bfc2b6ff9667c99920054401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,248,189,102,105,175,71,88,191,194,182,255,150,103,201,153,32,5,68,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
