The vertex set of a building can be naturally decomposed into subsets called Grassmannians. The book contains both classical and more recent results on Grassmannians of buildings of classical types. It gives a modern interpretation of some classical results from the geometry of linear groups. The presented methods are applied to some geometric constructions non-related to buildings - Grassmannians of infinite-dimensional vector spaces and the sets of conjugate linear involutions.\n\nThe book is self-contained and the requirement for the reader is a knowledge of basic algebra and graph theory. This makes it very suitable fo\n\n# Hardcover: 224 pages\n# Publisher: World Scientific Publishing Company (August 31, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 981431756X\n# ISBN-13: 978-9814317566","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c8615c32d996d5aaa0b78de6f8efe90f188ffdb","amp;dn":"Grassmannians+of+Classical+Buildings+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c8615c32d996d5aaa0b78de6f8efe90f188ffdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,134,21,195,45,153,109,90,170,11,120,222,111,142,254,144,241,136,255,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
