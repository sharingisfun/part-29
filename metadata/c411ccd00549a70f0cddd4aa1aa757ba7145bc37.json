Once a teacher, now a burnout with a predilection toward tie-dye shirts...and a hankering for heroin. She is volatile, emotionally abusive, and fascinating. Truly, she is a study in the depths that addiction can take people that, at one point, were functioning normally. A well-adjusted youth, college graduate, and athlete, we see Lauren transform into a moody malcontent, willing to trample over her own mother to get her fix. Intervention, season 2, episode 21.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c411ccd00549a70f0cddd4aa1aa757ba7145bc37","amp;dn":"Intervention+S02E21+-+Lauren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c411ccd00549a70f0cddd4aa1aa757ba7145bc37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,17,204,208,5,73,167,15,12,221,212,170,26,167,87,186,113,69,188,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
