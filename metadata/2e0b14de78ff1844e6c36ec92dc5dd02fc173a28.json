A range of missions from time attack in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSnake Road MissionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ alongside other action and racing-style missions puts playersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ strategy and quick-thinking skills to the test beyond simply showing off their deadly fighting skills.\n\n\n\nBut no Dragon Ball Z game would be complete without its fair share of spectacular battles. Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World uses a simplified battle system taken from the recently released next-gen Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit for thrilling hand-to-hand fighting on the ground, or flying leaps and aerial combat in the skies. In addition, new ideas have been added to the battle system. Defeat your opponent by blasting damaging Ki attacks from the sky or by diving into him and launching an explosive smash attack.\n\n\n\nThe game features over 40 unique characters, not counting the different forms that each character can transform into which multiplies the playing potential. On top of characters, fighting techniques and battle stages, Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World also includes selected drama scenes from the previous games all presented using beautifully refined effects and shading techniques.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e0b14de78ff1844e6c36ec92dc5dd02fc173a28","amp;dn":"Dragonball+Z+Infinite+World+PAL+PS2DVD-REV0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e0b14de78ff1844e6c36ec92dc5dd02fc173a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,11,20,222,120,255,24,68,230,195,110,201,45,197,221,2,252,23,58,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
