Turning to rock in 1980, he sang in rock bands with guitarist Nik Lloyd, such as Overdrive, Orion and Enigma, and in 1983 he joined the band Shy. He recorded four albums with AOR/hair metal band Shy, including the critically acclaimed Excess All Areas and toured with Shy, supporting Gary Moore, Meatloaf, Twisted Sister, Bon Jovi, Magnum, Manowar, Badlands, Enuff Z Nuff, Sleez Beez, UFO, and the Ian Hunter/Mick Ronson outfit which he performed on stage with in Brighton, just prior to Mick's death. The tours spanned the whole of Europe and North America, it was here that Tony worked with L.A. based band, Cinderella on their debut album, Night Songs. Co-writing sessions came about with Don Dokken (Dokken), Michael Bolton, Michael Des Barres (Power Station), John Parker (Chicago), Jeff Paris and Bob Kulick.\n\nTony left Shy in 1991, when MCA picked him up as a solo artist to record his first album in Manchester with engineer Andy Macpherson and guitarist Bob Maxim along with various members of 10CC and Sad Cafe. Later, forming another band, Siam, he wrote and sang on two albums, Prayer and The Language of Menace. After working as a session vocalist through the 1990s with Slade, Simon Harrison, Dave Saylor and Cozy Powell (unreleased) in conjunction with his recording and touring work with Siam, the band eventually folded in 1996 and Mills spent a year fronting a Rush tribute band, YYZ. In 2000 he reunited with Shy for two more albums, 'Unfinished Business' and 'Sunset and Vine'. At the turn of the millennium, he also released two solo albums, Cruiser and Freeway to the Afterlife. There followed a Danish tour with The Sweet, as bassist and lead vocalist, but this did not work out, and he returned to Shy, only to move swiftly on.\n\n Over My Dead Body 2015\n\nTrack List:\n1.
