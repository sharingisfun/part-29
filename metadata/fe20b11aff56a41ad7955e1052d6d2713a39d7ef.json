ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s infectiously energetic, which very nearly compensates for his not-terribly-strong vocals. On songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Old Lonesome HomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRolled and TumbledÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, MasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scratch-tastic licks carve out a sonic landscape that is both comfortably familiar and refreshingly new.\nSo far, so good, so safe. What elevates this album far above the ordinary run of blues-guitar offerings are the many incidental flourishes that Mason grafts onto the basic blues template. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome So LongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRiding OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ both feature short, pithy raps from Cody Burnside (grandson of blues legend RL Burnside), which against all odds mesh seamlessly with the tunes. African instruments like djembe and balafone percolate throughout several tracks, adding layers of percussive interest, notably in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRiding OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFreeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. With these global sounds added to the country accents of harmonica, mandolin and fiddle, the sonic palette grows richer song by song. Recommended. \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. My Old Lonesome Home \n02.
