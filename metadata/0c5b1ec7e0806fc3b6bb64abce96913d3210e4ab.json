This file replaces \\\\\\&quot;QI.S08.RedNoseDay.Special.2011.avi\\\\\\&quot;, which I posted yesterday (15th May 2011). This new file has better quality video (but is still from a screen capture): XviD AVI 720x400 780Kbps at 25fps, with mp3 224Kbps audio.\n\nThis video includes the warmup, then QI (including two adverts for Red Nose Day), then a retake. I have also uploaded another file that contains just the QI show, without the warmup or adverts or retake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5b1ec7e0806fc3b6bb64abce96913d3210e4ab","amp;dn":"QI.S08.RedNoseDay%2Bwarmup%2Bads%2Bretake.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5b1ec7e0806fc3b6bb64abce96913d3210e4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,91,30,199,224,128,111,195,182,187,100,171,206,150,145,61,50,16,228,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
