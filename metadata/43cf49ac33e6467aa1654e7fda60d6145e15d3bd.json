John Charles Julian Lennon was born on April 8, 1963, in Liverpool, and as a child, inspired several Beatles compositions: &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; reportedly arose out of a drawing Julian made of a classmate, and following his parents' divorce, he became the subject of Paul McCartney's sympathetic &quot;Hey Jude.&quot; Julian began playing guitar and drums at age ten, adding piano as a teenager; he appeared as a drummer on the track &quot;Ya Ya&quot; on the John Lennon album Walls and Bridges. Following his father's assassination, Lennon decided to pursue a singing career, although he worried that his vocal and stylistic similarity to his father would prove detrimental. He initially signed a contract to record an unreleased song taken from John Lennon's vaults, but after thinking better of it, he enlisted Yoko Ono's help in buying out the contract. Lennon signed with Atlantic and recorded his debut album, Valotte, at a French chateau of the same name. The album produced four chart singles, including the Top Tens &quot;Valotte&quot; and &quot;Too Late for Goodbyes&quot;; Lennon was nominated for a Grammy for Best New Artist. The follow-up, 1986's The Secret Value of Daydreaming, reached the Top 40, along with its single &quot;Stick Around.&quot;\n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1984-2011\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cues, Logs, Audiocheckers\n\n\n\n\n1984 - Valotte\n\n1986 - The Secret Value Of Daydreaming [16-44 Vinyl]\n\n1989 - Mr. Jordan\n\n1991 - Help Yourself\n\n1991 - Saltwater (Single)\n\n1998 - Photograph Smile\n\n2011 - Everything Changes\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43cf49ac33e6467aa1654e7fda60d6145e15d3bd","amp;dn":"Julian+Lennon+-+Discography+%281984-2011%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43cf49ac33e6467aa1654e7fda60d6145e15d3bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,207,73,172,51,230,70,122,161,101,78,127,218,96,214,20,94,21,211,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
