The song led Soul Asylum to international status, and helped bring their album, Grave Dancers Union to a multi-platinum level.\n\n  It was the third single off the album and reached No. 5 on the Billboard charts. It won a Grammy Award for the best rock song in 1994.\n\nThe song has become synonymous with the band, and has led many people to believe that it is the group's only hit, categorizing Soul Asylum as a one-hit wonder band. However, the band's 1995 hit Misery also charted, and therefore they are not considered to be a one-hit wonder. &quot;Runaway Train&quot; continues to receive a lot of airplay on the radio today, with disc jockeys often making mention of the influential music video that accompanied the song.\n\n   There are two versions of the music video, one for the United Kingdom and one for the United States: The video for the United States begins with a fade to a black screen with big, white blocked text reading: &quot;There are over one million youth lost on the streets of America&quot;, whereas the UK version begins with &quot;100,000 youth are lost on the streets of Britain&quot;. Next shown is a drawing of a girl, and a Dave Pirner voice-over says that the drawing is by a girl who had run away more than 110 times. The scene was often omitted when the video was shown, a common practice when videos had additional footage before or after the song.\n\n\n                            ***Runaway Train.(Version 1)***\n\n\n                                  Enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40c6369ba93b06059fb2db93071983251ecab6b9","amp;dn":"Soul+Asylum-Runaway+Train%281993%29%28Promo+Only%29-Wushan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40c6369ba93b06059fb2db93071983251ecab6b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,198,54,155,169,59,6,5,159,178,219,147,7,25,131,37,30,202,182,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
