It was preceded by the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October and the 1992 film Patriot Games, all three featuring Clancy's fictional character Jack Ryan. It is the last film version of Clancy's novels to feature Harrison Ford as Ryan and James Earl Jones as Vice Admiral James Greer, as well as the final one directed by Phillip Noyce.\n\nAs in the novel, Ryan is appointed U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Acting Deputy Director and discovers that he is being kept in the dark by colleagues who are conducting a covert war against drug lords in Colombia, apparently with the approval of the President of the United States. The film premiered in theaters in the United States on August 3, 1994, and was a major financial success earning over $200 million at the box office. On August 2, 1994, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the Milan Records music label. The soundtrack was composed and orchestrated by musician James Horner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:212d1cf8eb65fd71192307c37baf05638815cf3d","amp;dn":"Clear+and+Present+Danger+%281994%29+DVD9+PAL+ENG+GER+CZECH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"212d1cf8eb65fd71192307c37baf05638815cf3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,45,28,248,235,101,253,113,25,35,7,195,123,175,5,99,136,21,207,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
