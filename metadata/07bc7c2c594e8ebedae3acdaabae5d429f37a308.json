Unfortunately, Dante is strictly a ladiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ man, and the FDNY isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly gay-friendly. For ten years, Griff has hidden his heart in a half-life of public heroics and private anguish.\n\nGriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s caution and DanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cockiness make them an unbeatable team. To protect his buddy, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing Griff wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t doÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ until a nearly bankrupt Dante proposes the worst possible solution: HotHead.com, a gay porn website where uniformed hunks get down and dirty. And Dante wants them to appear thereÃ¢â‚¬â€together. Griff may have to guard his heart and live out his darkest fantasies on camera. Can he rescue the man he loves without wrecking their careers, their families, or their friendship?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07bc7c2c594e8ebedae3acdaabae5d429f37a308","amp;dn":"Hot+Head+by+Damon+Suede","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07bc7c2c594e8ebedae3acdaabae5d429f37a308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,188,124,44,89,78,142,190,218,227,172,218,171,174,93,66,159,55,163,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
