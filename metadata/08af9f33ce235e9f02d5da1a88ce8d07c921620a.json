Touch signals that he'll keep trudging on despite the ill health (though he's not entirely convincing!). The jam in Stranger is nice, with some good input from Bobby, Brent, and Phil. Everyone seems to be listening to each other really well. Bobby's guitar is really loud in the mix. Franklins is nice, but not amazing. Memphis has Bobby digging deep on the vocals. Big RR and Around &amp; Around provide a rocking end to the set and give you some hope that the second set might take off.\n\nSet II: Bobby brings some real enthusiasm to Sugar Mag, and it seems to infect the rest of the boys as well. Just like Stranger during the first set, Scarlet reveals that the boys are really listening to each other on this night. Good transition from Scarlet to Estimated, which can sometimes be clumsy given the rhythm difference (4/4 to 7/8). Bobby's vocal improv section in Estimated is good (not great). The transition from Estimated to Eyes seems a little abrupt, like the jam was going well and somebody just wanted to move along to Eyes. The jam for Eyes is likewise good, but short. Wheel&gt;GSL&gt;Watchtower is strong with Watchtower in particular kickin into high gear. The lyrics to Black Peter are a good reflection of Jerry feeling like crap. The fact that there is literally no jam whatsoever after he sings &quot;go run and see&quot; tells me that he can't wait to get off the \nstage. Box is nice encore, of course - and it spares Jer from having to sing another song.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08af9f33ce235e9f02d5da1a88ce8d07c921620a","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1988-04-07+-+Centrum+in+Worcester%2C+MA++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08af9f33ce235e9f02d5da1a88ce8d07c921620a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,175,159,51,206,35,94,159,2,213,218,26,136,206,141,7,201,33,98,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
