The liner notes tell it was partially inspired by cult theorist Aleister Crowley, who spent most of his life practicing and writing about the concept of 'Magick.' The music of IAO is classic Zorn: dark ambient exoticism, ethnic percussion exercises, hypnotic suspense-film music, thrash, and avant-garde classical.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/iao-r586725/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/iao-r586725/review&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4051f28af27e3917c47f958949c1821f1b7015f2","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+IAO+Music+In+Sacred+Light","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4051f28af27e3917c47f958949c1821f1b7015f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,81,242,138,242,126,57,23,196,127,149,137,73,193,130,31,27,112,21,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
