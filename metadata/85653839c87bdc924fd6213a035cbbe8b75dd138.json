A slow cashier is making you late. Your burglar alarm is ringing. The reaction you haveÃ¢â‚¬â€anxious, irritated, scaredÃ¢â‚¬â€is your limbic brain at work.\n\nHistorically, this part of our brain only fired when there was real, immediate danger. Now, everyday life elicits the same reaction. Overly sensitive to discomfort, we are in fight or flight mode with nothing to fight or flee from. In order to manage our discomfort, we reach for a drink, eat a pint of ice cream, become ill, or lose our temperÃ¢â‚¬â€and have no idea why.\n\nBut Dr. Marc Schoen does. In Your Survival Instinct Is Killing You, he explains why our limbic brain is in overdrive and how we can teach it to relax. Outlining easy techniques for readers that soothe the survival instinct, this book helps readers ditch bad habits, alleviate stress, boost health, improve decision making, and pursue happier lives.\n\n---\n\nMOBI, PDF\n\n---\n\nspanikopita torrents http://thepiratebay.se/user/spanikopita/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85653839c87bdc924fd6213a035cbbe8b75dd138","amp;dn":"Your+Survival+Instinct+by+Schoen+%28prerelease%29+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85653839c87bdc924fd6213a035cbbe8b75dd138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,101,56,57,200,123,220,146,79,214,33,58,3,92,187,232,183,93,209,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
