The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978f5396ae122c45ebc5adbd406f02537b8e6ef1","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+Server+for+e-business+4.50+-+14.089+-+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978f5396ae122c45ebc5adbd406f02537b8e6ef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,143,83,150,174,18,44,69,235,197,173,189,64,111,2,83,123,142,110,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
