Two of the album's three lengthy tracks (&quot;Vigil&quot; and &quot;Welcome&quot;) feature the legendary saxophonist with his classic quartet (including bassist Jimmy Garrison, drummer Elvin Jones, and pianist McCoy Tyner). \r\n\r\nAnd these pieces have the open, exploratory, modal feel familiar to fans of Coltrane's A LOVE SUPREME period. \r\n\r\n&quot;Kulu Se Mama&quot; itself features an expanded line-up that includes saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, drummer Frank Butler, bassist and bass clarinetist Donald Garrett, and percussionist/singer Juno Lewis (who wrote the piece), with an African feel that includes layered polyrhythms and chanted vocals.\r\n\r\nThis LP, re-released in 2000 and whose contents have been reissued in different sets on CD, features John Coltrane in two different settings. &quot;Vigil&quot; and the spiritual ballad &quot;Welcome&quot; showcase tenor saxophonist Coltrane with his classic quartet (pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones) in June 1965. \r\n\r\nDating from October 14, 1965, it adds tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, Donald Garrett on bass clarinet and second bass, second drummer Frank Butler, and percussionist-vocalist Juno Lewis to the quartet and is a bit of an oddity. Lewis' chanting and colorful percussion make this a unique if not essential entry in Coltrane's discography.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n1.
