Many of the songs on Double Platinum were remixed and differ from their original versions: in the case of &quot;Strutter,&quot; it was re-recorded with a slight disco beat and dubbed as &quot;Strutter '78.&quot; \r\n\r\nOther songs (&quot;Hard Luck Woman,&quot; &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;) had sections completely removed, while the beginning of &quot;Black Diamond&quot; was repeated at the end, fading out at the start of the first verse and giving the song a &quot;wrap around&quot; feel. The overall sound of the album is slightly flat and compressed, to give a similar sound to the varying productions of each track which are taken from the albums between the years 1974 up to 1977.\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Strutter '78&quot;   \tPaul Stanley, Gene Simmons \t3:43\r\n2. \t&quot;Do You Love Me?&quot;   \tStanley, Bob Ezrin, Kim Fowley \t3:32\r\n3.  \t&quot;Hard Luck Woman&quot; (Remix) \tStanley \t3:23\r\n4. \t&quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot; (Remix) \tSimmons \t3:20\r\n5. \t&quot;Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll&quot; (Remix) \tStanley, Simmons \t2:15\r\n6. \t&quot;Love Gun&quot;   \tStanley \t3:17\r\n7. \t&quot;God of Thunder&quot;   \tStanley \t4:14\r\n8. \t&quot;Firehouse&quot; (Remix) \tStanley \t3:20\r\n9. \t&quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot;   \tStanley \t3:30\r\n10. \t&quot;I Want You&quot;   \tStanley \t3:02\r\n11. \t&quot;Deuce&quot; (Remix) \tSimmons \t3:02\r\n12. \t&quot;100,000 Years&quot; (Remix) \tStanley, Simmons \t3:24\r\n13. \t&quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; (Remix) \tStanley, Ezrin \t3:35\r\n14. \t&quot;Rock Bottom (Intro)/She&quot; (Remix) \tAce Frehley, Stanley/Simmons, Stephen Coronel \t5:27\r\n15. \t&quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;   \tStanley, Simmons \t2:48\r\n16. \t&quot;Beth&quot;   \tPeter Criss, Stan Penridge, Ezrin \t2:45\r\n17. \t&quot;Makin' Love&quot;   \tStanley, Sean Delaney \t3:12\r\n18. \t&quot;C'mon and Love Me&quot; (Remix) \tStanley \t2:54\r\n19. \t&quot;Cold Gin&quot;   \tFrehley \t4:22\r\n20. \t&quot;Black Diamond&quot; (Remix) \tStanley \t4:14\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\nKiss\r\n\r\n    Paul Stanley â€“ rhythm guitar, lead vocals\r\n    Gene Simmons â€“ bass guitar, lead vocals\r\n    Ace Frehley â€“ lead guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Peter Criss â€“ drums, lead vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f2bc3bedf074018f0e606b9faa8734038bfb43","amp;dn":"KISS+-+Double+Platinum+1978+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f2bc3bedf074018f0e606b9faa8734038bfb43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,242,188,59,237,240,116,1,143,14,96,107,159,170,135,52,3,139,251,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
