What a Wonderful World\n\nThe Jerry Garcia Band's Fall 1991 East Coast tour is fondly remembered \nas one of the band's peak moments, a run of shows brimming with energy, \nwit and heart. The Hampton show was particularly enlivened by Bruce Hornsby, \nwho sat in the entire night on electric piano.\n\nThe Hampton set list is classic late-period JGB, including several newly \nintroduced tunes. Brand-new to the repertoire on this tour were &quot;Ain't No \nBread in the Breadbox&quot; (Norton Buffalo), the Manhattan's 1980 soul hit \n&quot;Shining Star&quot;, and Van Morrison's &quot;Bright Side of the Road&quot;. Another Van \nMorrison song, &quot;He Ain't Give You None&quot; was also played, having been unearthed \nin 1991 from the Garcia-Saunders Band's early 70s songbook. Chuck Berry's \n&quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; made its East Coast debut on the tour: be prepared for \na rave-up when Jerry and Bruce trade ripping solos and ascend rock 'n' roll \nOlympus.\n\nThe highlight of the show may have been a special new encore: the magnificent \n&quot;What A Wonderful World,&quot; originally recorded by Louis Armstrong in 1967. \nPlayed by the Jerry Garcia Band only ten times, and always as an encore, &quot;What \nA Wonderful World&quot; became an instant audience favorite. Jerry seems to draw \nin his performance from the same spirit of benevolence and grace from which \nSatch drew on his memorable track.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909203e8e921b98579878d98b79d35c0fc13619b","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+Band+-+1991-11-09+-+Hampton+Coliseum+in+Hampton%2C+VA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909203e8e921b98579878d98b79d35c0fc13619b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,146,3,232,233,33,185,133,121,135,141,152,183,157,53,192,252,19,97,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
