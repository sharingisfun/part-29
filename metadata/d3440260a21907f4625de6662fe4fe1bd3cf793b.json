It is an industrial rock band, the most recognized one since the genre was introduced. \n\nNine Inch Nails (known as NIN for short) was formed in Cleveland, Ohio, circa 1988, and have so far released seven full-length studio albums, as well as many EPs, remix albums, and live releases. Reznor is the only official member and has always been solely responsible for the musical direction of the band. His lyrics are largely concerned with the exploration of the self, but with his most recent albums, Year Zero and The Slip, the lyrical focus has shifted somewhat to extrospection. After recording a new album, the assembly of a new band usually follows, along with extensive touring; the live component of Nine Inch Nails is largely considered a separate entity from NIN in the recording studio. NIN's live shows often involve visually spectacular elements such as screens and lighting rigs, which were used on the Self Destruct, Fragility, With Teeth Arena Tours (Fall &amp; Spring) and Performance 2007 tours, and often culminate with the destruction of musical instruments. \n\nRipped with itunes\n\nRATE &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;\n\n&quot;HYPERPOWER!&quot; \n&quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢\n&quot;Survivalism&quot; \n&quot;The Good Soldier&quot; \n&quot;Vessel&quot; \n&quot;Me, I'm Not&quot;\n&quot;Capital G&quot; \n&quot;My Violent Heart&quot;\n&quot;The Warning&quot; \n&quot;God Given&quot;\n&quot;Meet Your Master&quot; \n&quot;The Greater Good&quot;  \n&quot;The Great Destroyer&quot; \n&quot;Another Version of the Truth&quot;\n&quot;In This Twilight&quot; \n&quot;Zero-Sum&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3440260a21907f4625de6662fe4fe1bd3cf793b","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Year+Zero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3440260a21907f4625de6662fe4fe1bd3cf793b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,68,2,96,162,25,7,244,98,93,230,102,47,228,254,27,211,207,121,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
