Otherwise, you will hear static.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\n\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nOne of my favorite albums of 2012. Wonderful voice and production. Mix is a perfect example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, to me. Enjoy.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01 Devotion\n02 Wildest Moments\n03 Running\n04 Still Love Me\n05 No to Love\n06 Night Light\n07 Swan Song\n08 Sweet Talk\n09 110%\n10 Taking in Water\n11 Something Inside\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba9eb11b557cb0eb315e2fb8229e228e2d4382f2","amp;dn":"Jessie+Ware+-+Devotion+%28SPEC+DTS+5.1+CD+by+DKA%29+%28SBU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba9eb11b557cb0eb315e2fb8229e228e2d4382f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,158,177,27,85,124,176,235,49,94,47,184,34,158,34,142,45,67,130,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
