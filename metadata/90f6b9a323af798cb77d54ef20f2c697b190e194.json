It contains an exhaustive and systematic listing of more than 9,000 formulae and 10,000 references with around 650 relevant websites. The unique approach of classifying the compounds by biological species together with their background information makes this particularly useful for marine biologists, and contributed significantly to the overwhelming success of the previous edition. The digital version now features a completely cross-linked library of compounds for easy access to related substances, making it even more useful for biologists, chemists and pharmacologists alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f6b9a323af798cb77d54ef20f2c697b190e194","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Marine+Natural+Products+-+2nd+Ed+%282014%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f6b9a323af798cb77d54ef20f2c697b190e194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,246,185,163,35,175,121,140,183,125,84,239,32,242,198,151,177,144,225,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
