Used visual cues only to beatmatch.  \n\nThe quality is NOT useable for broadcast or playing live, but it's a decent little mix and I am sure if you are into this kind of music you will definitely enjoy it.\n\nAs I have now, today, just figured out how to get the headphones working with the mixer program, I will be uploading more of these mixes soon.  \n\nBTW, I was a NYC area club DJ for about a decade when a much younger man - a DJ without a day job.\n\nI hope you will enjoy hearing this as much as I did mixing it.\n\nThe MP3 soundfile is just under one hour long, 320kbps, Dolby 5.1 without any silence or breaks, and it scans virus free with Avast Internet Security (fully updated).\n\n\nCheck back for future uploads, and feedback your opinion...  Please seed as much as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3c661fbd2c671d708034932c6ce2897ac676960","amp;dn":"Psychotrance+Club+Mix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3c661fbd2c671d708034932c6ce2897ac676960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,198,97,251,210,198,113,215,8,3,73,50,198,206,40,151,172,103,105,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
