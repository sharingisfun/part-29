I currently have about 3000.  I always looked for their unreleased songs rather than their demos and sessions of songs on the albums.  If this is the same for you, you need not look any further.  \n\nThis collection spans from before they were a group (Pre-Beatles) to unreleased rarities from when they were split.  Exactly 191 songs are in this collection.\n\nOnly a  few of these are from Anthology.  Anthology is a well-known set of rarities and sessions that is easily available via bittorrent.  \n\nSo basically, to possess nearly every beatles album, you need:\n\nThe Beatles Discography\nThe Beatles Anthology (all three discs)\nand finally, this torrent.\n\nNOTE:  Not all of these are masters.  Some are very hard to hear the vocals.  But it is still cool to have nearly every single beatles song ever.  ENJOY!\n\nNOTE AGAIN:  Nearly all these songs CAN be found on bittorrent, this is just a well-organized collection of actual songs.  It is NOT for competists who want everything the beatles ever recorded, just fans who want to hear every different song they made.\n\nHere are the list of songs, jesus this is gonna take a while (alphabetical order):\n\nAbandoned Love\nAcross The Universe (decided to put a sweet version in here)\nAdagio for Strings\nAerial Tour Instrumental\nAin&amp;#039;t She Sweet\nAll I Want Is You\nAll Things Must Pass (alt)\nAnother Day\nThe Back Seat of My Car\nBay Boy\nBar Unoriginal\nBeautiful Boy\nBesame Mucho\nBetween The Devil and The Deep Blue Sea\nBeware of Darkness\nBlue Moon of Kentucky\nBoil_Crisis\nCarol\nCatch The Wind\nCayenne\nChild of Nature\nChristmas Time Is Here Again\nCircles\nClarabella\nCome and Get it\nCommonwealth\nCoochy Coochy\nCosmic Empire\nCrying, Waiting, Hoping\nThe Day I Went Back To School\nDaydream \nDehra Dun\nThe End MegaMix\nEvery Grain of Sand\nEvolution Take 5\nEverybody had a hard year\nFast Rocker\nFine Madonna\nflying Horses\nFlying Hour\nFree as a bird\nFriendship Tales of Frankie Rabbit\nGimme Some Truth\nGoing Down To Golder\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Green\nGoodbye\nGopala Krishna\nGrow Old With me\nHallelujah I love her so\nHanglide\nHappy Rishikesh Song\nHear Me Lord\nHeather\nHey Bulldog\nHoney, Hush\nHottest Gong In Town\nHow Do you Do it?\nI Call your name\nI Don\\\\\\&amp;#039;t need no cigarette, boy\nI Got To Find My Baby\nI Hate To See\nI Just Dont Understand\nI Lost my little girl\nI WIll always be in love with you\nI\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll get you\nI\\\\\\&amp;#039;m Down\nI\\\\\\&amp;#039;m Gonna love you too\nI\\\\\\&amp;#039;m gonna pay for his ride\nI\\\\\\&amp;#039;m in love\nI\\\\\\&amp;#039;m the greatest\nI\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve been good to you\nIf not for you\nIf you love me baby\nIn spite of all the danger\nIn The middle of an island\nIndia\nThe Inner Light\nIs it Discovered\nIt Dont come easy\nJohnny Be Goode\nJoy, Joy, Joy\nJubilee\nKeep your hands off my baby\nKomm Gib Mir Deine\nLady Jane\nLennon Medley\nLong Haired Lady\nLong Tall Sally\nLucille\nMadman\nMama youve been on my mind\nMartha my dear\nMatchbox\nMaxine\nMemphis\nThe Mess\nMidnight Special\nMilk Cow Blues\nMr. H Atom\nMucho Mungo\nMy Carnival\nMy Imagination\nMy Old Friend\nNews of the day\nNightmares\nNo Pakistanis\nNonsense\nNot Guilty\nOh My Soul\nOld Siam Sir\nOn the Road to Marrakesh\nOn The Wings of a Nightinggale\nOne Way Love Affair\nOnly you\nOuttakes Medley\nOver and Over again\nPayment\nPicasso\nPieces of my heart\nRain\nRamblin Love\nReal Love\nRide Rajbun\nRocker\nRode All Night\nSchool Days\nScouse THe Mouse\nSearchin\nSeptember in the rain\nShanghai Surprise\nShe is so beautiful\nShes a Woman\nSheik of Araby\nSide by Side\nSie Leib Dich\nSlippin and Slidin\nSlow Down\nSmile Away\nSoldier of Love\nSome Days\nSong of Love\nSpeak To Me\nSpin It On\nSpiritual Regeneration\nStormy Weather\nSuicide\nSure to fall\nSuzy\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Parlour\nTake good care of my baby\nTake me home quick one\ntaking a trip to carolina\ntears of the world\nteddy boy\ntennessee\nthank you girl\nThird man theme\nThis boy\nThree cool cats\nTill there was you\nTo Kingdom Come\nTo know her is to love her\nToo bad about sorrows\nTragedy\nTrue Love\nTwenty Flight Rock\nTwice in a lifetime\nHey good lookin\nthe Walk Jam\nWatching Rainbows\nWatching the wheels\nWhat a day for a daydream\nWhen Irish eyes are smiling\nWhite Power\nWilliam Smith Boogie\nWine, Women, Loud Songs\nThe Wishing book\nThe World is waiting for the sunrise\nYes it is\nYou know my name (look up the number)\nYou must write everyday\nYou win again\nYou\\\\\\&amp;#039;re Sixteen\nYour name is Ted\nYour True Love\nYvonne\n1882","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5700e88d126614b13f2ea5f36bfe5b7cde1ae4a0","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Nearly+200+Unreleased+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5700e88d126614b13f2ea5f36bfe5b7cde1ae4a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,0,232,141,18,102,20,177,63,46,165,243,107,254,91,124,222,26,228,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
