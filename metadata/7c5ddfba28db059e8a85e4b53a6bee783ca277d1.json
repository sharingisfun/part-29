In fact, no new members would be added (although some would leave) until 1998's Calling All Stations.\nThe addition of Steve Hackett on guitar and Phil Collins on drums brought the band closer to a progressive rock idiom, as Hackett introduced a more aggressive, electronic sound, and Collins brought the dexterity and power necessary to add a bit of an edge to the wimpey-ness.\n\nHighlights of the album include the almost flawless &quot;Musical Box&quot;, which epitomizes the strengths of the progresive rock genre. At times restrained, at times roaring, the song moves through a number of motifs while not getting bogged down in the pretentiousness so many bands fall into. Another song I enjoy is the melancholy &quot;Seven Stones&quot;, which uses the old prog gimmick of drowning the listener in Mellotron. I won't complain. I also like the acoustic numbers, &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; and &quot;Harlequin&quot;, which may commit the cardinal sin of not being ten minutes long, but are at least not boring\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5ddfba28db059e8a85e4b53a6bee783ca277d1","amp;dn":"Genesis+-Nursery+Cryme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5ddfba28db059e8a85e4b53a6bee783ca277d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,93,223,186,40,219,5,158,138,133,228,181,58,107,238,120,60,162,119,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
