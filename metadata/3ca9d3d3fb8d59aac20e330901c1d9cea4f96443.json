It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, \nEngland, and was the band's first album to reach number 1 in the UK, while it reached \nnumber 55 in the US chart, eventually going gold there. A remastered CD was released in 1994\nin the UK and the United States, and again in 2011. Ron Geesin, who had already influenced \nand collaborated with Roger Waters, made a notable contribution to the album and received a \nthen-rare outside songwriting credit.\n\nThis was the first Pink Floyd album to be specially mixed for four-channel quadraphonic sound\nas well as conventional two-channel stereo. The SQ quadraphonic mix was released on LP in a \nmatrix format compatible with standard stereo record players. There was also a release of \nthe quadraphonic version in the UK in fully discrete four-channel form on the &quot;Quad-8&quot; \nformat, a four-channel variant of the stereo 8-track tape cartridge.\n\nThe cover was, like earlier albums, designed by Hipgnosis, and was significant in that it \nwas the first one to not feature the band's name on the cover, or contain any photographs \nof the band anywhere. This was a trend that would continue on subsequent covers throughout \nthe 1970s and beyond.\n\nAlthough it was commercially and critically successful on release, the band, particularly \nWaters and David Gilmour, have expressed several negative opinions of the album in more \nrecent years. Nevertheless, it remained popular enough for Gilmour to perform the title \ntrack with Geesin in 2008.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSIDE A:\n01.
