Here's ours, enjoy.\n\n-\nCo produced by Gorillaz/Damon Albarn and Danger Mouse, &quot;Demon\nDays&quot; was recorded at the band's own Kong Studios. The album is\na darker and more intense affair than 2001's &quot;Gorillaz&quot;. The \ncolours are rich, dark and heavy, while the rhythms are clean,\nstrategic and relentless.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e59046dc0de362ef48f73e11677806608ea6cabf","amp;dn":"Gorillaz-Demon+Days-%28Retail%29-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e59046dc0de362ef48f73e11677806608ea6cabf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,144,70,220,13,227,98,239,72,247,62,17,103,120,6,96,142,166,202,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
