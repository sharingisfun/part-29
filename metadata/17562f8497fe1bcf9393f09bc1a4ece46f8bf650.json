If anything, the group sounds leaner and meaner.  Hard Times in the Land of Plenty is one of their finest releases for this reasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a rough and tumble collection that is driven as much by fine original songwriting as it is by the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s edgy sound. \n \nHard Times is Omar's first major label release for Columbia and he probaly got signed on due to a certain somebody named Stevie Ray Vaughn. The title track got some airplay on MTV (back when MTV actually showed videos and not second rate garbage as Blink 182's Drummer and Wife) which got me interested to buy this album. The album is chock full of some of that Louisana via Texas hoodoo blues and rock with highlights such as the Howling Wolf soundalike, Don't You Know That I Love You, Creedence type of rock such as Shadow Man, and You Ain't Fooling Nobody and tex mex sounding Don't You Rock Me The Wrong Way. Double Trouble keyboardist Reese Wynans helps out as well. Tastefully recorded, it's one of the undiscovered gems of the 80s. Grade B+ ~ R. Smith\n\nBought this &quot;CD&quot; on cassette tape when it originally released.   I'm happy to see it's now on CD. Nice original songwriting with coarse, butt kicking delivery. Fans of SRV would probably like this. Give it a listen. ~ Snotter &quot;brown dog fan&quot;\n\nOmar &amp; The Howlers - Hard Times In The Land Of Plenty Track: \n01  Hard Times in the Land of Plenty \n02  Dancing in the Canebrake \n03  Border Girl \n04  Mississippi Hoo Doo Man \n05  DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Rock Me the Wrong Way \n06  Same Old Grind \n07  DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t You Know \n08  You AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t FoolinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Nobody \n09  Shadow Man \n10  Lee Anne","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17562f8497fe1bcf9393f09bc1a4ece46f8bf650","amp;dn":"Omar+%26+The+Howlers+-+Hard+Times+In+The+Land+Of+Plenty+%281987%29+%5BBl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17562f8497fe1bcf9393f09bc1a4ece46f8bf650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,86,47,132,151,254,27,207,147,147,240,155,193,164,236,228,111,139,246,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
