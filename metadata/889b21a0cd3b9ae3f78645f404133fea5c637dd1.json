Regardless of the plot, the quality of the stop-motion is very nice and the film is fun. As for the story, a young black kid is taking a pie to the Deacon's house and the wily scarecrow wants to get that pie--even if it means scaring the wits out of poor Jasper.\n\n\nDirector:\nGeorge Pal\nStars:\nRex Ingram, Victor Jory\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:889b21a0cd3b9ae3f78645f404133fea5c637dd1","amp;dn":"Jasper+and+the+Haunted+House+%281942%29%28flv%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"889b21a0cd3b9ae3f78645f404133fea5c637dd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,155,33,160,205,59,154,227,247,134,69,244,4,19,63,234,92,99,125,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
