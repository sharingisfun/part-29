Released by Columbia Pictures, it stars Ken Marshall as Prince Colwyn and Lysette Anthony as Princess Lyssa.\n\nThe film's most distinguished features include a robust score by James Horner, its early screen roles for actors Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane, and its surrealistic set design within the Black Fortress. It opened to mixed reviews but later would become a cult classic thanks to its entertainment, production values and visual work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd447c75afd67442206fa9b66b64082f46bb7e90","amp;dn":"Krull+1983+720p+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd447c75afd67442206fa9b66b64082f46bb7e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,68,124,117,175,214,116,66,32,111,169,182,107,100,8,47,70,187,126,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
