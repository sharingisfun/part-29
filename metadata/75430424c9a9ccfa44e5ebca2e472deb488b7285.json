According to Fox's revisionist account, Jane was faithful to the opportunistic Boleyn clan; she didn't rush to slander her husband, but succumbed under Thomas Cromwell's relentless interrogation, repeating an indiscretion by Anne about Henry's sexual dysfunction. Moreover, Fox says, George's execution was a financial blow to Jane as his royal perquisites of lands and offices were seized. \n\nJane clawed her way back to a senior court position when she was ordered by Catherine Howard to pass messages to her lover, and Jane's complicity, according to Fox, opened the door for historians to excoriate Jane for her sister-in-law's death. \n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75430424c9a9ccfa44e5ebca2e472deb488b7285","amp;dn":"Jane+Boleyn+-+The+True+Story+Of+The+Infamous+Lady+Rochford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75430424c9a9ccfa44e5ebca2e472deb488b7285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,67,4,36,201,169,204,250,68,229,235,202,46,71,45,235,72,139,114,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
