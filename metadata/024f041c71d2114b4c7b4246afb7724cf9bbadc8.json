Help Wanted: Angel   \nCommunity Score\n7.4 Good\nFirst aired: 11/21/1984\n\nMartin Lamm is waiting to hear that his script will become a movie, checking with the front desk clerk frequently to \nsee if any mail has arrived for him. None ever does.\n\nMartin&amp;#039;s friend, Joey,nails a poster on a pole asking for an &quot;angel&quot; in the sense Martin needs one: someone with the \nmoney to help him turn his script into a movie. Jonathan and Mark respond to the poster, not knowing what kind of \nangel Joey is looking for.\n\nWhile Jonathan and Mark are finding out what kind of angel Joey is looking for, a man named Petros arrives with the \nposter in his hand. He loves the script and wants to make the movie. Petros at first scoffs at Martin&amp;#039;s idea of using \npeople from the neighborhood as actors in the movie, but Jonathan suggests they might find a star among the \namateurs, save money and help people at the same time.\n\nWriter: Dan Gordon\nDirector: Michael Landon\nGuest star: Jack Jozefson (Guy), Robert Telford (Preacher), Ed Hooks (Clerk), Jack Bernardi (Jake), Owen Bush \n(Sam), Stella Stevens (Stella), Al Ruscio (Petros), Dennis Fimple (Joey), Jon Lormer (Martin Lamm), Randy Gallion \n(Chewey) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:024f041c71d2114b4c7b4246afb7724cf9bbadc8","amp;dn":"Highway+to+Heaven+-+S01E10+-+Help+Wanted+Angel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"024f041c71d2114b4c7b4246afb7724cf9bbadc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,79,4,28,113,210,17,75,76,123,66,70,175,183,114,76,249,187,173,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
