Biomass is an abundant carbon-neutral renewable feedstock for producing fuel. First-generation biofuels gained attention for their problems, but the authors of this book demonstrate that they are well on their way to creating practical and sustainable second-generation biofuels.\r\n\r\nThe book begins with an introduction to synthetic biology. Next, it covers pretreatment technologies, advanced microbial technologies, genetic engineering as it relates to biofuel technologies, and nanotechnology and chemical engineering in relation to biofuels.\r\n\r\nWell-respected in his field, the editor's firsthand experience gives him the perspective to create a thorough review of the relevant literature. Each chapter is written by experts in biotechnologies, offering graduate and post-doctorate students, as well as other scientific researchers, a wide-angle look at biofuel technologies. At the same time, this volume points to promising directions for new research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0755404c187e1554c81a5f161bddd465b3822ea","amp;dn":"New+Biotechnologies+for+Increased+Energy+Security","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0755404c187e1554c81a5f161bddd465b3822ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,117,84,4,193,135,225,85,76,129,165,241,97,189,221,70,91,56,34,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
