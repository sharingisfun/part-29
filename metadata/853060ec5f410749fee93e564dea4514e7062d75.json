It was requested in the forums at www.ComicSearch.co.uk.  I believe this to be a complete collection (except for some variant covers).  If there is anything else out there please let me know.\n\nThere is no Wikipedia entry.  So think of a T and A version of X-Files or Kolchak.\n\nFrom Atomic Avenue\nThe hunt for a collection of ancient coins, roaming bands of vicious vampires, and tight, short clothing are just some of the irritants a female police officer and a psychic coroner must deal with in this title.\n\nFilled with good girl pinups, a very busy story and lots of action, this offering from writers David Campiti and Al Rio offers a unique twist on the vampire legend. While the connection between the coins, a series of brutal Catholic murders in Old Town San Diego, and Judas Iscariot is more contrivance than explanation, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still there. And for those who find even that too much plot to deal with, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plenty of distraction offered by the skintight, rip-away outfits that fall off the heroines every other page.\n\nThanks to David Campiti, Al Rio, the scanners, uploaders and anyone else who should be thanked for making this possible.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:853060ec5f410749fee93e564dea4514e7062d75","amp;dn":"Exposure+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"853060ec5f410749fee93e564dea4514e7062d75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,48,96,236,95,65,7,73,254,233,62,86,77,234,69,20,231,6,45,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
