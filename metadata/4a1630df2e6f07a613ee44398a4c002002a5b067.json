He documents how FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highly repressive and tightly controlled regime produced food for troops and civilians; regular pay for soldiers, farmers, and factory workers; and protection of property rights for both large and small landowners. These factors, combined with the NationalistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pro-Catholic and anti-Jewish propaganda, reinforced solidarity in the Nationalist zone.\n\n    Seidman concludes that, unlike the victorious Spanish Nationalists, the Russian and Chinese bourgeoisie were weakened by the economic and social upheaval of the two world wars and succumbed in each case to the surging revolutionary left.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;This work is unique. Seidman persuasively argues that the victory of FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nationalists cannot be fully explained by military, political, and cultural factors. By examining everyday experience in the Nationalist zone, particularly material and economic conditions, he accounts for the stability and efficiency of the Nationalist war effort.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Sasha Pack, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMichael Seidman is professor of history at the University of North CarolinaÃ¢â‚¬â€œWilmington.
