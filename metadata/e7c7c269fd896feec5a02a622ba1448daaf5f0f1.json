It was released as the B-side to &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; in 1964, their last single release that year. It reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 from frequent airplay.\n\nThe song, penned by Paul McCartney (though credited to Lennon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ McCartney), was his attempt at imitating the vocal style of Little Richard. This is why the song is in such a high register, even for McCartney's tenor range. Some takes of the song (especially recordings of live concerts) feature an extended outro. John Lennon was quoted as saying, &quot;We were so excited to say 'turn me on' you know, about marijuana and all that... using it as an expression.&quot;\n\nThe structure of the song is fairly simple, with the melody carried mostly by McCartney's voice. His bass and a backing piano produce a countermelody, with Lennon's guitar playing chords on the backbeat. After the first verse, the piano also plays chords on the upbeats. George Harrison plays a bright guitar solo during the middle eight.\n\n&quot;She's A Woman&quot; was a direct influence on Bob Dylan's song &quot;Obviously 5 Believers&quot; which appeared on his 1966 album Blonde On Blonde.\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She's_a_Woman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She's_a_Woman&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KanaiAAEO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KanaiAAEO&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 4000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:00\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
