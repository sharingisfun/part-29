UK based MCÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s take these\ninfluences, mix them up with local references and styles\nthus creating an identity of Black British culture. This\nis constantly evolving not just musically but also in\nterms of each subsequent generationÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s relationship to\nBritish society. As Tricky put it in Massive Attack&amp;#039;s Blue\nLines, of &quot;English upbringing, background CaribbeanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®\n\nAn England Story shows the links and musical path from the\narrival of UK Dancehall and Soundsystems in the early\n1980s, through successive musical movements such as\nJungle, UK Hip-Hop, up to todayÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s Garage, Grime and\nDubstep.\n\nThe global pre-eminence of American hip hop means that\nmusic like grime and UK hip hop is often seen as a form of\nrap, whereas it owes as much to reggae music and culture\nas it does to any American influence. Black music in\nBritain has fashioned its own identity in contrast to that\nof America, Africa, or elsewhere, by drawing on the unique\nrelationship that the UK has with the Caribbean. As Rodney\nP (of celebrated 80s UK Hip-Hop group London Posse) says:\n\n&quot;This is a UK thing, it&amp;#039;s hip hop and it&amp;#039;s reggae and we\ndo reggae - and those Americans don&amp;#039;t know about that&quot;.\n\nSince the evolution of the &amp;#039;fast chat&amp;#039; dancehall style of\nthe early 80s, the influence of reggae music and culture\nhas been crucial to the development of urban music in\nBritain: from the heavy sampling of Jamaican\nvocals/instrumentals employed by jungle, hardcore and\ngarage, to grime&amp;#039;s London take on the soundclash, the\nriddim version and patois-inflected rhymes. The importance\nof the Jamaican soundsystem concept and its dubplates,\nspecials, clashes and heavy, heavy bass is a constant\nthroughout these different stylistic mutations\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:892ffcd53ccd7b85c34e2dcf110aaf99c932a2f3","amp;dn":"An+England+Story+-+25+Years+of+the+MC+in+the+UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"892ffcd53ccd7b85c34e2dcf110aaf99c932a2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,47,252,213,60,205,123,133,195,78,45,207,17,10,175,153,201,50,162,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
