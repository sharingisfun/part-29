If few recognize that distinction, then it's because the Brothers Four were also part of a largely forgotten chapter in the history of folk music in America.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by James Christopher Monger\n\nThis two-fer from Collectors' Choice Music features the Brothers Four's second record -- 1960s Rally Round the Brothers Four -- and their third -- 1961's Roamin' with the Brothers Four. Despite the inclusion of folk revival favorites like &quot;Nine Pound Hammer,&quot; &quot;Follow the Drinkin' Gourd,&quot; &quot;My Tani,&quot; and &quot;Blue Water Line,&quot; these are not two of the group's most solid efforts, rendering this collection for completists only.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r818208&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r818208&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nRally 'Round the Brothers Four\nAMG Review by Greg Adams\n\nRally 'Round the Brothers Four, the folk quartet's non-charting second album, contains the minor hit &quot;My Tane,&quot; sometimes spelled &quot;My Tani,&quot; their ill-fated follow-up to &quot;Greenfields.&quot; The album contains a typical assortment of seafaring songs, traditional folk songs, and novelties. Despite the acoustic instrumentation and folk material, the arrangements frequently incorporate pop music devices such as modulating up a semitone or shifting from minor to major keys. In 1960, commercial folk groups in rapidly increasing numbers were recording many of the same songs, but the Brothers Four at least put their own stamp on tried and true repertoire like &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot; and &quot;Beneath the Willow.&quot; Some of the group's later albums, on which they worked with less obvious material, are superior to the comparatively nondescript Rally 'Round the Brothers Four.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/rally-round-the-brothers-four-r95988&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/rally-round-the-brothers-four-r95988&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nRoamin' with the Brothers Four\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95991&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95991&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E112SO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E112SO&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
