We are looking at an epidemic that&amp;#039;s going to face us in 15/20 years which the health service will find impossible to deal with.&quot;\n\nWith hospital admissions for alcoholic liver disease doubling in the last ten years, Deborah attends a liver transplant operation - the only hope of survival for many patients. She speaks to the beneficiary of the healthy liver, a social drinker whose cirrhosis crept up on her - by the time she knew she was ill, her only chance of survival depended on the transplant.\n\nLiver specialists at hospitals across the country tell Deborah they are seeing a surge in young professional patients with severe forms of alcoholic liver disease - people who don&amp;#039;t consider themselves to be heavy drinkers.\n\nOne doctor says: &quot;We&amp;#039;re seeing more and more people who work in the City or work busy jobs who drink socially, with meetings, entertaining clients, come home in the evening, have half a bottle of wine or more just to relax after a busy day&amp;#039;s work. They&amp;#039;re not getting drunk, they&amp;#039;re not dependent, they have high-profile, high-powered jobs and yet they get liver disease.&quot;\n\nPaul, an accountant in his fifties with alcohol related liver disease is one such patient, he says: &quot;You always know in the back of your mind that you&amp;#039;re drinking too much, but you just sleep walk into this.&quot;\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Dispatches.Drinking.Yourself.To.Death.WS.PDTV.XviD-REMAX.avi\nFilesize.....: 348 MB (or 356,698 KB or 365,258,752 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:46:22 (69,539 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 910 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 132 kb/s (66/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\u0002Ã‚Â°\nFrame Size...: 640x352 (1.82:1) [=20:11]\nLanguage.....: English\n\n\n\n\n\ned2k://|file|Dispatches.Drinking.Yourself.To.Death.WS.PDTV.XviD-REMAX.avi|365258752|4477CDBDD8DE6471478A6181E6815CE9|/\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a8c78366adab26d1a2f4bdb766180744b1e64ba","amp;dn":"Dispatches+Drinking+Yourself+To+Death+WS+PDTV+XviD+REMAX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a8c78366adab26d1a2f4bdb766180744b1e64ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,140,120,54,106,218,178,109,26,47,75,219,118,97,128,116,75,30,100,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
