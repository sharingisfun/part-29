This book combines recent findings from diverse disciplines into one comprehensive reference. Complete with case histories from a variety of environments, it covers:\r\n\r\nBiofilm formation\r\nCausative organisms, relating bacteria and fungi to corrosion mechanisms for groups of metals\r\nDiagnosing and monitoring MIC\r\nElectrochemical techniques, with an overview of methods for detection of MIC\r\nThe impact of alloying elements, including antimicrobial metals, and design features on MIC\r\nMIC of non-metallics\r\nStrategies for control or prevention of MIC, including engineering, chemical, and biological approaches\r\n\r\nThis is a valuable, all-inclusive reference for corrosion scientists, engineers, and researchers, as well as designers, managers, and operators","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:429109ca3e3db9bfb277fbe4f195ed7ebf1177cf","amp;dn":"Microbiologically+Influenced+Corrosion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"429109ca3e3db9bfb277fbe4f195ed7ebf1177cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,145,9,202,62,61,185,191,178,119,251,228,241,149,237,126,191,17,119,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
