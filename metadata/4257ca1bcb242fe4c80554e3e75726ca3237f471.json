People dealing with traumatic changes, driven by the mystery of what happened and why. Some of them have been affected in mysterious ways, and some will have certain abilities, both good and bad. The pilot has a ball of light sailing towards Earth. But rather than the expected catastrophic event, thousands of returned abductees are left with no memory of their otherworldly experiences. Each has been gone anywhere from a few months to several decades but hasn&amp;#039;t aged a day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4257ca1bcb242fe4c80554e3e75726ca3237f471","amp;dn":"The+4400+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4257ca1bcb242fe4c80554e3e75726ca3237f471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,87,202,27,203,36,47,228,200,5,84,227,231,87,38,202,50,55,244,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
