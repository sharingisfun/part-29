She is given an assignment, requiring to organise the wedding preparations for Eun Min, the daughter of a major Japanese investor in the company. Min Se is both reckless and problematic. Ha Kyung has difficulty meeting her expectations, and soon discovers that the fiancÃƒÂ©e is not another man named Seo In Jae, but the one she divorced five years earlier. In Jae suggests putting someone else in charge of the project, but she completely rejects that notion, as the assignment will decide the future position of a branch manager for her, and cannot afford to take such risk. However, things do not work the way she intended. They rekindle moments of their first love and the wedding plans start to go astray. They even end up spending a night together, while Min Se is away overseas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978cfe5b0e8c6bcd73714ed470c29ec7782ac2e1","amp;dn":"Drama+Special+-+Another+Wedding","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978cfe5b0e8c6bcd73714ed470c29ec7782ac2e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,140,254,91,14,140,107,205,115,113,78,212,112,194,158,199,120,42,194,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
