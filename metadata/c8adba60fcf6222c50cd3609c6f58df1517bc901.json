Starting with only seventy-four men, a gladiator named Spartacus incited a rebellion that threatened Rome itself. With his fellow gladiators, Spartacus built an army of 60,000 soldiers and controlled the southern Italian countryside. A charismatic leader, he used religion to win support. An ex-soldier in the Roman army, Spartacus excelled in combat. He defeated nine Roman armies and kept Rome at bay for two years before he was defeated. After his final battle, 6,000 of his followers were captured and crucified along Rome's main southern highway.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8adba60fcf6222c50cd3609c6f58df1517bc901","amp;dn":"The+Spartacus+War+%282009+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8adba60fcf6222c50cd3609c6f58df1517bc901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,173,186,96,252,246,34,44,80,205,54,9,198,245,141,241,81,123,201,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
