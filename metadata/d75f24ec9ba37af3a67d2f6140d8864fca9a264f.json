The group -- which has had a rotating cast of musicians over the years -- has always been known for its instrumental dexterity, but Daniels and company were also notorious for their down-home, good-old-boy attitude; in the early '80s, they became a virtual symbol of conservative country values. Daniels and his band experienced the height of their popularity at the end of the '70s and early '80s, but they remained a popular concert attraction well into the '90s. \n\n\n\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01.Tangled Up In Blue\n02.Times They Are A Changin'\n03.I'll Be Your Baby Tonight\n04.Gotta Serve Somebody\n05.I Shall Be Released\n06.Country Pie\n07.Mr. Tambourine Man\n08.Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall\n09.Just Like A Woman\n10.Quinn The Eskimo\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d75f24ec9ba37af3a67d2f6140d8864fca9a264f","amp;dn":"Charlie+Daniels+-+Off+The+Grid+Doin%27+It+Dylan+2014+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d75f24ec9ba37af3a67d2f6140d8864fca9a264f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,95,36,236,155,163,122,243,166,125,47,97,64,216,134,79,202,154,38,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
