Check out the line up - Dupree, Edwards and Jenkins of session supergroup Stuff with Purdy keeping it in the pocket and Ramirez and Rodriguez holding down the latin side of things.  Mix these elements with loads of strings, hissing high hat, some girlie backing vocals and a bit of 70's cheese and you have a monster latin disco set with two stand out dancefloor bombs:\n&quot;Barrio Nuevo&quot; does it for me every time with the intro timbale roll sliding into a not quite cha cha cha of guiro, vibes and strings which breaks out into mambo / mozambique styled sections for vibes and rhodes solo spots - it's all about the tension and release.\n\nHis [Ramirez] version of 'Do It Any Way You Wanna' passes the original version and leaves it in the dust.  The Ramirez take on the tune has a much more aggressive tempo and an absolutely dynamic arrangement.  The opening shock of strings, giving way to the drum breakdown, then on to the familiar riff really grabs your ears in a way that the PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Choice version never really achieves.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really mind blowing when you place the versions side by side, that the Louie Ramirez record, with its amazing blend of latin, funk and disco wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a hit. ~ Larry (Funky16corners)\n\nPersonnel:\nDrums - Bernard Purdy\nGuitar - Cornel Dupree\nCongas - Arthur Jenkins\nPercussion - Johnny Rodriguez\nPiano - Paul Griffin\nSaxophone - Bob Porcelli\nVibraphone, Timbales - Louie Ramirez\nBass - Gordon Edwards, Rasan Jemmott Mfalme, William Salter\nBacking Vocals - Erik Alexander, Liz Lampert, Susan Skye\n\nLouie Ramirez - A Different Shade of Black Tracks:\n01 A1 Salsa \n02 A2 You Need A Man\n03 A3 A Different Shade Of Black    \n04 A4 Latin Rhapsody    \n05 A5 Laura\n06 B1 Do It Any Way You Wanna    \n07 B2 School\n08 B3 Bad Luck    \n09 B4 Barrio Nuevo    \n10 B5 If I Should Lose You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d1d8820660ef2c6a35b81b841c9403c7990f14c","amp;dn":"Louie+Ramirez+-+A+Different+Shade+of+Black+%281976%29+%5BSalsa%5D%5Bmp3+32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d1d8820660ef2c6a35b81b841c9403c7990f14c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,29,136,32,102,14,242,198,163,91,129,184,65,201,64,60,121,144,241,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
