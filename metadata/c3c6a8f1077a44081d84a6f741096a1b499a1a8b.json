(Wiley-Blackwell, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-470-67114-6\r\n\r\nFood Processing: Principles and Applications second edition is the fully revised new edition of this best-selling food technology title.Advances in food processing continue to take place as food scientists and food engineers adapt to the challenges imposed by emerging pathogens, environmental concerns, shelf life, quality and safety, as\r\nwell as the dietary needs and demands of humans. In addition to covering food processing principles that have long been essential to food quality and safety, this edition of Food Processing: Principles and Applications, unlike the former edition, covers microbial/enzyme inactivation kinetics, alternative food processing technologies\r\nas well as environmental and sustainability issues currently facing the food processing industry.\r\n\r\nThe book is divided into two sections, the first focusing on principles of food processing and handling, and\r\nthe second on processing technologies and applications. As a hands-on guide to the essential processing principles and their applications, covering the theoretical and applied aspects of food processing in one accessible volume, this book is a valuable tool for food industry professionals across all manufacturing sectors, and serves as a relevant primary or supplemental text for students of food science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c6a8f1077a44081d84a6f741096a1b499a1a8b","amp;dn":"Food+Processing+-+Principles+and+Applications+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c6a8f1077a44081d84a6f741096a1b499a1a8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,198,168,241,7,122,68,8,29,132,166,247,65,9,106,27,73,154,26,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
