The series was created by Steve Dildarian, and is about a hapless man in his mid 20s named Tim (Steve Dildarian) who lives in New York City with his girlfriend Amy. Throughout the series, Tim constantly finds himself in increasingly awkward situations in both his work and personal life.[1] The first season aired in 2008 and has since been aired in numerous countries, and has developed something of a cult following. The second season debuted on February 19, 2010 on HBO. On June 4, 2010, HBO announced it was canceling the show, but there were rumors that it may be picked up by another network--perhaps even Comedy Central, which originally rejected the show before HBO picked it up. [2] On the 16th of August, 2010 it was announced HBO had reversed their original decision to cancel the show, and as a result, a third season was ordered.[3] HBO has announced that season 3 of The Life and Times of Tim will premier on December 19th. [4] The first season was released on DVD on 9 February, 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f23276da39ec2c9dcef748b5fc6eb62f23d4604","amp;dn":"The.Life.And.Times.Of.Tim.Season2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f23276da39ec2c9dcef748b5fc6eb62f23d4604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,35,39,109,163,158,194,201,220,239,116,139,95,198,235,98,242,61,70,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
