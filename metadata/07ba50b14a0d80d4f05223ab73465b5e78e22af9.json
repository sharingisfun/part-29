She also meets Alex Wheatley (Josh Duhamel), the manager of a local convenience store, and his children, Lexie (6) and Josh (8). Alex's wife died of cancer, and he keeps letters written by her, to be given to their children in important moments of their lives.\n\nWith Jo's encouragement, Katie and Alex begin a romantic relationship. Lexie immediately accepts Katie, while Josh is initially resistant, believing Katie to be his mother's replacement, but eventually accepts her as well. Meanwhile, Kevin continues to search for Katie using his authority as a police officer, and forges reports that she is a wanted murderer. Upon seeing her picture in the police station, Alex confronts Katie and tells her to leave town. He then realizes that he should've given her a chance to explain herself and goes to find her at the ferry dock. She reveals that her husband is on a hunt for her. Alex promises to protect her. Kevin is fired for misusing police resources. After breaking into Mrs. Feldman's home and listening to a phone message that Katie had left for her, Kevin heads to Southport to find her, after calling the number to figure out where she was.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07ba50b14a0d80d4f05223ab73465b5e78e22af9","amp;dn":"Safe+Haven.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07ba50b14a0d80d4f05223ab73465b5e78e22af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,186,80,177,74,13,128,212,240,82,35,171,115,70,91,94,120,226,42,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
