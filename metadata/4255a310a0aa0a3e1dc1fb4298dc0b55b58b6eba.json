I&amp;#039;ve equalized the tracks quite alot, both to get the overall tone more to my liking, aswell as correcting/equalizing some annoying artifacts like ringing or resonant frequencies that I can&amp;#039;t stand to listen to, especially on headphones.\nAlso originally this recording is quite flat and uncompressed, which can be great since the sond is very open. But I added a compressor aswell as being slightly more aggressive with limiting the output, in order to get a bit more ducking and instrument interaction to the songs, which I think can sound better if done in moderation, especially if you have hall/room reverbs on drums so that they aren&amp;#039;t as &quot;sterile&quot;.\n\nHope you enjoy, and comment on the torrent comment section if you want to.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4255a310a0aa0a3e1dc1fb4298dc0b55b58b6eba","amp;dn":"Pantera+-+Vulgar+Display+Of+Power+1992+%28Custom+Optimization%2C+200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4255a310a0aa0a3e1dc1fb4298dc0b55b58b6eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,85,163,16,160,170,10,62,29,193,251,66,152,220,11,85,181,139,110,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
