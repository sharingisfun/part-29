In reality, he hopes to \n                      reak revenge on the people who ruined his life centuries\n                      earlier. There's only one circumstance that can potentially\n                      thwart his plan: Dracula falls hopelessly in love with a \n                      woman who seems to be a reincarnation of his dead wife.\n\n    IMDB rating ....: 7.7/10 from 14,214 users  \n\n    Notes ..........: It seems that TvTeam failed with this one. They forgot to\n                      upload episode 7 and didn't seed episode 6. So here's a full\n                      release including all episodes.
