RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can. WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives. It can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.\nWinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries.\n\nWinRAR - What's new in the latest version\n\n\n   Version 5.21\n\n   1. &quot;Drag and drop context menu&quot; options in &quot;Settings/Integration/\n      Context menu items&quot; dialog allow to disable WinRAR archiving\n      and extraction commands in context menu displayed after dragging\n      and dropping files with right mouse button.\n\n   2. If winrar.ini file is present in the same folder as WinRAR installer,\n      winrar.ini will be copied to WinRAR program folder after completing\n      installation.\n\n   3. While previous versions could produce RAR5 volumes of slightly\n      smaller than requested size sometimes, such situation is less\n      likely now. In most cases volume size equals to specified by user.\n\n   4. Now by default WinRAR skips symbolic links with absolute paths\n      in link target when extracting. You can enable creating such links\n      with &quot;Allow absolute paths in symbolic links&quot; option on &quot;Advanced&quot;\n      page of extraction dialog or with -ola command line switch.\n\n      Such links pointing to folders outside of extraction destination\n      folder can present a security risk. Enable their extraction only\n      if you are sure that archive contents is safe, such as your own backup.\n      \n   5. Bugs fixed:\n\n      a) WinRAR 5.20 issued unnecessary user account control (UAC) prompt,\n         when running an executable from archive stored in UAC protected\n         folder. Since nothing is extracted to folder containing an archive\n         in such case, UAC prompt is not needed;\n\n      b) WinRAR could overwrite files with read-only attribute only\n         when unpacking RAR and ZIP archive formats. Now it is also\n         implemented for other archive formats supported by WinRAR;\n\n      c) &quot;Elapsed time&quot; and &quot;Time left&quot; were displayed incorrectly\n         when applying &quot;Convert&quot; command to multiple archives\n         and enabling &quot;Add recovery record&quot; option.\n\nHome Page www.rarlab.com\nInterface: english","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cccfeb34f11327af58f91a3c1e72220b9ebce207","amp;dn":"WinRAR+5.21+Final+%5BEn%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cccfeb34f11327af58f91a3c1e72220b9ebce207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,207,235,52,241,19,39,175,88,249,26,60,30,114,34,11,158,188,226,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
