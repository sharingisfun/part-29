Most kids were infatuated with the look of Kiss, not their music. Decked out in outrageously flamboyant costumes and makeup, the band fashioned a captivating stage show featuring dry ice, smoke bombs, elaborate lighting, blood spitting, and fire breathing that captured the imaginations of thousands of kids. But Kiss' music shouldn't be dismissed -- it was a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late '80s. Kiss was the brainchild of Gene Simmons (bass, vocals) and Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar, vocals), former members of the New York-based hard rock band Wicked Lester; the duo brought in drummer Peter Criss through his ad in Rolling Stone and guitarist Ace Frehley responded to an advertisement in The Village Voice.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Strutter\n02.Deuce\n03.Hotter Than Hell\n04.C'mon And Love Me\n05.Rock And Roll All Nite (Live)\n06.Detroit Rock City\n07.Beth\n08.Hard Luck Woman\n09.Calling Dr. Love\n10.Love Gun\n11.Christeen Sixteen\n12.I Was Made For Lovin' You\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b1e04b54dad00ebbe0b28bc8515e4362208daa","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282003%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35b1e04b54dad00ebbe0b28bc8515e4362208daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,177,224,75,84,218,208,14,187,224,178,139,200,81,94,67,98,32,141,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
