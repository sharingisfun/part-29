If you choose to \n\ninstall, do so at your own risk and only if you're comfortable in the \n\nprocess of upgrading and downgrading your device software. It is quite \n\nnormal during operating system development for certain features to be \n\ncrippled or disabled while others are tested, and these beta builds often \n\nreflect that. They are not always better. Depending on your BlackBerry \n\ncomfort level, it may be best for you to wait for community feedback on a \n\nbuild before deciding to download and install for yourself or simply wait \n\nfor the next official release. If you require support, you will find it in \n\nour CrackBerry forums via our extremely knowledgeable community base - do \n\nnot contact your carrier or RIM for Beta OS technical support (their first \n\ncourse of action will be to advise you to downgrade to a supported OS). \n\nPackage Version: 5.0.0.661\nConsisting of:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Applications: 5.0.0.411\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Software Platform: 5.2.0.33\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢File name: 9000M_PBr5.0.0_rel661_PL5.2.0.33_A5.0.0.411\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢File size: 120 MB\n\nInstructions to install on ANY 9000 from ANY CARRIER.\n\n1.
