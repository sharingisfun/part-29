For this album, the band spelled their names in what they thought were &quot;exotic&quot; ways. In September of 1987 they released their second album, Retaliation. Soon after their second album was released, the band broke up and Peter Steele formed a new band called Subzero, which would later be renamed Type O Negative. According to the sleeve notes of the &quot;Top Shelf Edition&quot; of their second album, the first Type O Negative album, Slow Deep and Hard was composed largely from material originally written for Carnivore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85ff743467661beb34de4211408657301874c73","amp;dn":"Carnivore-Retaliation+1987+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85ff743467661beb34de4211408657301874c73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,95,247,67,70,118,97,190,179,77,228,33,20,8,101,115,1,135,76,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
