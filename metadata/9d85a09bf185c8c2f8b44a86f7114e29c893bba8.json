Along the journey, we see archival footage of rehearsals, performances, and private moments including a Miami concert resulting in Morrison's arrest and trial for indecency. His love of the spotlight, his desire to be a poet, and his alcohol-fueled mood swings lead to a back and forth between public and private desires, successes, and failures. The band's music plays throughout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d85a09bf185c8c2f8b44a86f7114e29c893bba8","amp;dn":"When.Youre.Strange.LIMITED.BDRip.XviD-SUBMERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d85a09bf185c8c2f8b44a86f7114e29c893bba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,133,160,155,241,133,200,194,248,180,74,134,247,17,78,41,200,147,187,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
