Excellent stereo soundboard. Great and loose rehearsal...enjoyable listen.\nThis bootleg features the same stuff as the VGP 4cd release &quot;The Complete Woodstock Tapes&quot;\nBut on this [non-label] bootleg, and also on the &quot;Red Devil&quot; release, there is 1 or 2 &quot;bonus songs&quot; at the end of each CD.\n\nThe artwork for this box will not match CD-cases, as it's a video-sized box with no &quot;jewel cases&quot;\nSo included is the artwork for the &quot;Red Devil&quot; release, as it has the same content as this one.\n(Note that track 17 of disc 3 is not mentioned on the artwork, while track 17 of disc 4 is mentioned...but NOT included on the CD itself)\n\nI know this material have made the rounds on torrent-trackers a lot of times, but I got a request for this bootleg a couple of months ago.....that's why I chose to rip &amp; torrent it.\n\nEnjoy....Erik_snow\n\n\nDISC 1\n01.
