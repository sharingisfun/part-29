On his shoulder, a tattoo of the Roman number XIII. And not a single memory of who he was, or how he got there. No sooner has he been nursed back to his feet by kind rescuers than armed goons track him down and attempt to kill him. Relentlessly pursued by assassins and secret agents, the man known as XIII begins a long quest to explore his past and recover his identity... From a presidential assassination to a coup dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tat in South America; from a deadly conspiracy within the corridors of Washington DC to a break-out from a high-security prison for the criminally insane; through an ever increasing list of aliases... XIII will forge on against formidable odds and powerful, merciless opponents, until he knows, at last, who he is. \n\n\n\nXIII 01 - The Day of the Black Sun\nA man washes ashore near an old coupleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house, barely alive. When he comes to, he has forgotten everything, including his name. The only clues to his identity: a key sewn into his clothes, a bullet wound to the head...and the number XIII tattooed on his shoulder. A meagre start to reconstruct oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abd7xMQv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abd7xMQv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abc9hUU2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abc9hUU2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 02 - Where the Indian walks\nXIII is looking for a certain Kim Rowlands, a woman with whom he saw himself in a photograph. His search will yield a name - his, perhaps - and take him to a place that may be home. All families have secrets, though, and they can get a man killed. And what exactly do General Carrington and his beautiful aide Lieutenant Jones want with him?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abbmNIEe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abbmNIEe.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adgcKzge.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adgcKzge.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 03 - All the Tears of Hell\nConvicted of murder and sent to a high-security prison for the criminally insane, XIII finds himself not only unable to continue searching for his past, but also at the mercy of his enemies. Unbeknownst to him, though, General Carrington and the beautiful (and deadly) Lieutenant Jones are still trying to unravel the mystery of the presidential assassination. All they have to do is find a way to help him before he loses his life...or his mind.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adg11FTk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adg11FTk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adiLaxhv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adiLaxhv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 04 - SPADS\nNow called Ross Tanner, XIII joins the elite SPADS (Special Assault and Destruction Squads) to try and learn more about Captain Rowland, his last identity. As if the shadowy threats hanging over his head werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough, he also has to contend with gruelling training and a hostile instructor. Meanwhile, in Washington, investigations continue, and a series of clues emerge, pointing towards people XIII thought his allies. Can he trust Colonel Amos, General Carrington or... Lieutenant Jones?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adsDgNyM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adsDgNyM.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adrnWRvh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adrnWRvh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 05 - Full Red\nXIII, Jones and Betty Barnowsky escaped the deadly trap set by Colonel McCall. Lost in a hostile jungle, they must now make their way back to America. And they must be quick: In Washington, every ally the fugitives ever had has been arrested in preparation for the conspiratorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ master stroke, coinciding with a general exercise of all American armed forces: Operation Full Red. Suddenly, XIIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest becomes a last-ditch fight for the freedom of an entire nation.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abk4hUay.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abk4hUay.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abbW7R1L.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abbW7R1L.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 06 - The Jason Fly Case\nWith the conspiracy that nearly claimed his life dismantled, XIII can finally turn all his attention towards uncovering his own distant past. Armed with everything he could find on Jason Fly - the man he seems to be - he heads to Green Falls, where he grew up. The problem with amnesia is that you never know exactly what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll dig up when you go home again. And... is everything really solved concerning the presidential assassination that cost him his memory?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/aceZFtbL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/aceZFtbL.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acx85z2s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acx85z2s.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 07 - The Night of August Third\nXIII and Jones are on the run. Hunted by local authorities, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re suspected of three murders, including that of The MongooseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hired killer. The sheriff of Green Falls, henchman to the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest landowner, is all too happy to accuse the fugitives: The two men donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want certain details from the past to surface. XIII is going to have to survive long enough to dig up the truth about what really happened on the night of August 3rd long ago...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acmk0Rmg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acmk0Rmg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abhGtP0I.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abhGtP0I.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 08 - Thirteen to One\nXIII survived the trip back to his childhood home. The Mongoose has finally been caught and is in a high-security jail. But there is still one piece of the puzzle missing, and when President Sheridan asks him to discover who the Number I is, the man now known as Jason McLane doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate for long. His best chance: finding Kim Rowland wherever she may be hiding. But the Mongoose has powerful allies and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay locked up forever...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adfqZbkP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adfqZbkP.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/act0bJVX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/act0bJVX.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 009 - For Mara\nJason McLane is on holidays with Jones at some friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in Central America, when a peculiar priest offers him startling news: He may very well be a married man! And because nothing is ever simple in XIIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, his apparent wife is none other than the leader of the democratic guerrillas in neighbouring Costa Verde, Maria De Los Santos - currently awaiting execution in a maximum security fortress. Time for the amnesiac to put his skills to good use again - for Maria.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abrWn3Zv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abrWn3Zv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abu27pRj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abu27pRj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 010 - El Cascador\nCaptured and imprisoned in the Roca Negra fortress, XIII is being tortured by the sinister Colonel Peralta. But, for all his pain and suffering, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also in the same building as Maria, the woman who may be his wife. And they have plenty of dedicated, resourceful friends outside... as well as at least one traitor. Still unsure of his past, Jason McLane will have no choice but to become the man known as &quot;El Cascador&quot; to clean up Costa Verde once and for all.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abgcTRgS.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abgcTRgS.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acn7f9zT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acn7f9zT.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 011 - Three Silver Watches\nXIII has freed a country, exposed a traitor, reunited with his wife... and found his father. As he deals - somewhat against his will - with the aftermath of the revolution in Costa Verde, Sean Mullway recounts for him his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history: Irish immigrants, remorseless Mafiosi, Mexican gold, and three silver watches. New answers will also bring new questions and a whole new set of potential enemies just as old ones come back to the fore.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acrLKtQX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acrLKtQX.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abtW7api.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abtW7api.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 012 - The Trial\nCalled back to the USA by the frantic government, McLane and Jones discover that General Carrington has kidnapped Wally Sheridan, President of the United States! Holed up in a secret base heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turned into a fortress, Carrington intends to put Sheridan on trial on live TV and expose him as the Number I of the conspiracy. To do that, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to need XIIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help in bringing in his main witness: the Mongoose!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adlM1VIO.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adlM1VIO.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adf9DTxu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adf9DTxu.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 013 - Top Secret\nThe Mongoose is dead. So is Number I. But, since he was the President of the United States, XIIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends are all on the run again. McLane, though, has been arrested, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being judged in secret by the heads of the American intelligence community. Sentenced to life in a secret prison, he has no illusions that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever reach it. The ruthlessness of the NSA Director proves him right - but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the only one who wants XIII dead.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abwL1RcM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abwL1RcM.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abeb2V5m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abeb2V5m.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 014 - Release the Hounds!\nHaving escaped from the clutches of IrinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organisation, XIII is on the loose in America but still hunted by both GiordinoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s NSA and IrinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top assassin, Jessica. As he tries to return to his friends in San Miguel, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forced to dodge bullets and outsmart various traps and ambushes. With the odds stacked against him, he will have to rely on help from an enemy and his own mounting anger at the constant string of attacks.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acb5s3dQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acb5s3dQ.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adymaJfg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adymaJfg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 015 - Operation Montecristo\nArrested by the Costaverdean authorities because of pressure from the US, XIII and his friends are awaiting their extradition. Instead, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re freed by Costaverdean troops in disguise. But they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford to stick around, as theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still on the run from the most powerful nation on Earth. Desperate for money, McLane decides to go after MaximilianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gold, as Mullway believes heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found the location of the third silver watch. The problem is that the location is under 150 feet of water...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acf9hwm4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acf9hwm4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/admfO48f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/admfO48f.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 016 - Maximilian's Gold\nXIII and his friends, still in hiding from the NSA, now have the riddle from all three silver watches... and MaximilianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gold is within their reach. But the treasure is well hidden. Not to mention that $15 million is enough to attract a lot of unwanted attention. Meanwhile, in Washington, an increasingly desperate Frank Giordino can feel the noose tightening around his neck - and men are at their most dangerous when desperate. All he needs is someone to bring him the right information...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abg7tZ1D.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abg7tZ1D.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/aclrnhOb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/aclrnhOb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 017 - The Irish Version\nLittle by little, XIII has reconstructed most of his life and figured out who he is. With one exception: There is still a gap in his college years, when Jason McLane became Kelly Brian. A gap that may mean the amnesiac adventurer is in fact an Irish terrorist, Seamus O'Neil. This flashback brings us back to Boulder, Colorado, and before that to Northern Ireland, to reveal the last piece of the XIII puzzle, and his final identity.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abmVX4e6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abmVX4e6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/aclDZSwL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/aclDZSwL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXIII 018 - The Last Round\nXIII and his friends have failed to recover MaximilianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gold and are tired of hiding, running and struggling. When two books come out in the USA relating all the events of the amnesiacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and the details of the Conspiracy of the XX, they see it as a possible chance to come out in the open and trust in their countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s justice. But they still have enemies, at home and abroad, and everyone is set on a collision course...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adyl8EAL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adyl8EAL.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abguVS9l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abguVS9l.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc2572c3e5ec1420265ef82d2721f2a6ff0067d","amp;dn":"XIII+1-18+%28Cinebook+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc2572c3e5ec1420265ef82d2721f2a6ff0067d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,194,87,44,62,94,193,66,2,101,239,130,210,114,31,42,111,240,6,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
