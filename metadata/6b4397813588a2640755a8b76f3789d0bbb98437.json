The entrance was concealed behind a cupboard. The cellar only had 5 m2 of space (approximately 54 ft2). It had a door made of steel, had no windows, and was soundproof.\n\nFor the first six months of her captivity, Kampusch was not allowed to leave the chamber at any time, and for several years after her kidnapping she was not allowed to leave the tiny space at night. Afterwards, she spent increasing amounts of time upstairs in the rest of the house, but each night was sent back to the chamber to sleep, and while Priklopil was at work. However, in later years, she was seen outside in the garden alone, and one of Priklopil's business partners also said that he met Kampusch nearby his home when her kidnapper, Wolfgang Priklopil, called and came to his home to borrow a trailer.\n\nAfter her eighteenth birthday, she was allowed to leave the house with Priklopil, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise. He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours. She initially denied that they had made the trip, but eventually admitted that it was true, although she said she had no chance to escape during that time.\n\nAccording to Kampusch's official statement after her escape, she and Priklopil would get up early each morning to have breakfast together. Priklopil gave her books, so she educated herself, and according to a colleague of his, she appeared happy.\n\nLater, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, &quot;I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company&quot;. But she also said: &quot;I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness.\n\n&quot;I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon on television and in the media. Thus you know how small it was. It was a place to despair.&quot; Dietmar Ecker, Kampusch's media advisor, said Kampusch told him Priklopil &quot;would beat her so badly she could hardly walk. When she was beaten black and blue, he tried to smarten her up. Then he would take his camera and photograph her&quot;.\n\nPriklopil had warned Natascha that the doors and windows of the house were booby-trapped with high explosives. He also claimed to be carrying a gun, and that he would kill her and the neighbours if she attempted to escape.\n\nNevertheless, Kampusch on one occasion fantasized about chopping his head off with an axe, although she quickly dismissed the idea. She also attempted to make noise during her early years of captivity by throwing bottles of water against the walls. She said that on trips out with Priklopil she had attempted in vain to attract attention.\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
