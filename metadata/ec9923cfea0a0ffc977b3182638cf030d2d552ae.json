Just another stupid bootleg you maybe think this is.... but it isn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t \n\nIn the summer of 2006 i had an idea of bringing all songs MM ever played live together. I was trading bootlegs for a half year then so i started to put songs with good performance/quality together. I\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve mastered all songs on this release with a program that i\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve used for over 4 years. It was very difficult to get rare performed songs, some of them are MP3 sourced. I\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve worked a fucking year on this now, this release is a MUST HAVE for every manson fan. Funny speeches, great performances, great quality, and fully mastered. (equalized, hiss removed, pops and clicks removed etc.) \n\nAs bonus i included my own made artwork . The back cover doesn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t contain the tracklisting because it doesn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t fit and it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s to keep the pictures intact. \n\nTracklisting.rtf :::: Here is the complete tracklisting of all cd\\\\\\&amp;#039;s \nDetailed Info.txt :::: Date, Place, Recording Equipment - All detailed info about the songs \n\nTracklisting: \n\nCD1: \n01 Intro \n02 Helter Skelter \n03 Kinderfelt (Early Version) \n04 Suicide Snowman \n05 My Monkey Intro (Strawberry Fields) \n06 My Monkey \n07 Wrapped In Plastic \n08 Get Your Gunn \n09 Broken Foot Speech \n10 White Knuckles \n11 Learning To Swim \n12 Dope Hat \n13 Down In The Park \n14 Cyclops \n15 Misery Machine \n16 Snake Eyes And Sissies \n17 Organ Grinder \n18 GodEatGod \n19 Coma White \n20 Cruci-fiction In Space \n21 Para-Noir \n\nCD2: \n01 Dogma \n02 1996 Speech \n03 Apple Of Sodom \n04 The Beautiful People (Acoustic) \n05 Posthuman \n06 Better Of Two Evils \n07 This Is Halloween \n08 Alabama Song \n09 mOBSCENE \n10 Surrender \n11 Personal Jesus \n12 Great Big White World \n13 Deformography \n14 Burning Flag \n15 It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s A Small World Speech \n16 This Is The New Shit \n17 Minute Of Decay \n18 Disposable Teens \n19 Cryptorchid \n20 Little Horn \n21 Irresponsible Hate Anthem \n\nCD3: \n01 Tourniquet \n02 Antichrist Superstar \n03 Sweet Dreams (Hell Outro) \n04 Angel With The Scabbed Wings \n05 1996 \n06 The Reflecting God \n07 Lunchbox \n08 Bottle Speech \n09 Cake And Sodomy \n10 The Fight Song Speech \n11 The Fight Song \n12 The Death Song Intro (Bible Speech) \n13 The Death Song \n14 Drugs Speech \n15 I Don\\\\\\&amp;#039;t Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me \n16 Rock \\\\\\&amp;#039;N\\\\\\&amp;#039; Roll Nigger Speech \n17 Rock \\\\\\&amp;#039;N\\\\\\&amp;#039; Roll Nigger \n18 The Beautiful People \n19 Parental Concern Speech \n\nCD4: \n01 Dried Up, Tied And Dead To The World \n02 Ashtonishing Panorama Of The Endtimes \n03 Use Your Fist And Not Your Mouth Speech \n04 Use Your Fist And Not Your Mouth \n05 Rock Is Dead Speech \n06 Rock Is Dead \n07 Doll-Digga-BuzzBuzz-Zigety-Zag \n08 Man That You Fear \n09 Born Again \n10 Disassociative \n11 In The Shadows Of The Valley Of Death \n12 Kinderfelt Speech \n13 Kinderfelt \n14 Tainted Love \n15 The Nobodies \n16 User Friendly \n17 The Golden Age Of Grotesque \n18 The Dope Show \n19 Valentine\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Day \n20 Mister Superstar \n21 I Want To Disappear \n\nCD5: \n01 (S)aint \n02 State Speech \n03 Mechanical Animals \n04 1999 Speech \n05 The Speed Of Pain \n06 The Last Day On Earth \n07 The Love Song \n08 Spine Of God (ft.
