Between this album and FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS in May 1969, Elvis would only release soundtrack albums, greatest hits package and one gospel album.\n\nIn this album, you have plenty of songs that would become later singles:\n\n-I'M YOURS (NÃ‚Â°11 in 1965)\n\n-EASY QUESTION (NÃ‚Â°11 in 1965)\n\n-THAT'S SOMEONE YOU NEVER FORGET (b-side in 1967)\n\n-KISS ME QUICK (NÃ‚Â°34 in 1964)\n\n-SUSPICION (a hit for Terry Stafford in 1964 then by Elvis himself in the UK but not before 1977 - NÃ‚Â°9 -)\n\nIt's not Elvis's best album but it contains those hits plus the fans favorite NIGHT RIDER, the Blue Hawaii left-over STEPPIN' OUT OF LINE, the latin FOUNTAIN OF LOVE, etc...\n\nThis is not where you want to start your Elvis collection (although it was a hit album: NÃ‚Â°4 in the US and NÃ‚Â°1 in the UK) but once you have become familiar with Elvis music, it gives you another glimpse at the many styles he could sing.\n\nThe remastered edition contains a TOP 5 US single (NÃ‚Â°1 in the UK) SHE's NOT YOU / JUST TELL HER JIM SAID HELLO and an Elvis-penned song called YOU'LL BE GONE that was a b-side to another single in 1965.\n\nIt's not JAILHOUSE ROCK, it's not even ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT, it's Nashville Elvis, it's the GOOD LUCK CHARM Elvis (if you know the song).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c92623ab58b98ee8bdea4abe9a5df3961cc2844c","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Pot+Luck+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c92623ab58b98ee8bdea4abe9a5df3961cc2844c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,38,35,171,88,185,142,232,189,234,74,190,154,93,243,150,28,194,132,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
