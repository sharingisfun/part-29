Over the years, with military cutbacks, the store of experienced military personnel had simply dwindled. After the destruction of Northern Virginia, he realized that it was necessary to tap the one group he had sworn never, ever, to recall: the few remaining survivors of the Waffen SS. Watch On the Rhine is perhaps the most unbiased, and brutal, look at the inner workings of the Waffen SS in history. Meticulously researched, it explores all that was good, and evil, about the most infamous military force in history using the backdrop of the Posleen invasion as a canvas.\n\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:438419a2366bc25ec570587d6344a0526546a1cb","amp;dn":"John+Ringo+and+Tom+Kratman+-+Watch+on+the+Rhine+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"438419a2366bc25ec570587d6344a0526546a1cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,132,25,162,54,107,194,94,197,112,88,125,99,68,160,82,101,70,161,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
