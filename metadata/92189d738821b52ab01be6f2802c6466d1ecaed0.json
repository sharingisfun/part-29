They are desperate to die, but every time they try to dash their ship to splinters and end their miserable existence, a malevolent God scoops them out of danger. And so they have no choice but to continue to sail the seas, looting and killing. Until one day, having exterminated yet another ship of the living, they come across a pink little baby.

But eventually the King begins to grow up...\n\nAdapted by David B., the acclaimed creator of Epileptic, from a short story by Pierre Mac Orlan (which was published decades before the release of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, thank you very much), The Littlest King is David B.'s first full-color graphic novel to be released in English, and his vivid palette combines with his stunningly elegant graphics to create a magical yarn that can be enjoyed by young and old alike.\n\n\nAlso by David B., Epileptic... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7690782/David_B_-_Epileptic_(Pantheon_Complete_Edition)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7690782/David_B_-_Epileptic_(Pantheon_Complete_Edition)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92189d738821b52ab01be6f2802c6466d1ecaed0","amp;dn":"David+B+-+The+Littlest+Pirate+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92189d738821b52ab01be6f2802c6466d1ecaed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,24,157,115,136,33,181,42,176,27,230,242,128,44,100,102,209,236,174,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
