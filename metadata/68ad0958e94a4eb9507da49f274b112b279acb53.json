Second only to Bob Dylan (and perhaps Paul Simon), he commands the attention of critics and younger musicians more firmly than any other musical figure from the 1960s who is still working at the outset of the 21st century, which is all the more remarkable an achievement for someone who didn't even aspire to a musical career until he was in his thirties.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t16222-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t96.29% CDDA &amp; 100.00% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Because Of\n02.In My Secret Life\n03.The Future\n04.I'm Your Man\n05.Dance Me To The End Of Love (Live)\n06.Waiting For The Miracle\n07.Everybody Knows\n08.Take This Waltz\n09.Closing Time\n10.A Thousand Kisses Deep\n11.Democracy\n12.There For You\n13.Love Itself\n14.Hallelujah\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.On That Day\n02.By The Rivers Dark\n03.Anthem\n04.Ain't No Cure For Love\n05.Tower Of Song\n06.First We Take Manhattan\n07.Tennessee Waltz (Live)\n08.If It Be Your Will\n09.Night Comes On\n10.Take This Longing\n11.Who By Fire\n12.Chelsea Hotel No. 2\n13.Famous Blue Raincoat\n14.Bird On A Wire\n15.The Partisan\n16.Suzanne\n17.Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye\n18.Sisters Of Mercy\n19.So Long, Marianne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed****\n                                      \n                                \n                                ****Thanks!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ad0958e94a4eb9507da49f274b112b279acb53","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282007%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ad0958e94a4eb9507da49f274b112b279acb53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,173,9,88,233,74,78,185,80,125,164,159,39,75,17,43,39,154,203,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
