Just when things are at their worst she discovers a unique sword with the power to take her revenge. Combining elements of Kill Bill, Highlander and Blade of the Immortal with the patented Luna  \nBrothers twist, The Sword will be a must read for any fan of the action, drama, or fantasy genres.\n&quot;We came up with The Sword two years ago,&quot; said artist Jonathan Luna. &quot;Every now and then it would pop into our conversations and never get out of our heads, so we knew this was a story that we had to tell.&quot;\n&quot;Jonathan and Joshua embody everything that Image Comics is about,&quot; added Image Comics&amp;#039; Publisher, Erik Larsen. &quot;We found them in a blind submission and through their work with us they&amp;#039;ve become industry superstars. I&amp;#039;m ecstatic to read their newest series.&quot;\n\n\nThanks to the original scanners ! Anyone that has 8-12, please post !
