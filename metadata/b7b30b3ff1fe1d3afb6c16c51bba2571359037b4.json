Shadows and Synyster Gates on their hit single &quot;The River&quot; from\nGood Charlotte's 2007 full-length Good Morning Revival. That adventurous musical\npersona continues with Cardiology, an album that features everything from the\ndance floor-friendly first single &quot;Like It's Her Birthday&quot; to future GC anthems\nsuch as &quot;Silver Screen Romance,&quot; while still effortlessly retaining the band's\nsignature sound in the process. While in some ways Cardiology is a return to\nform for these multiple Warped Tour headliners, it also manages to work in\nelements from throughout the band's classic catalog to create an album that\nsimultaneously summarizes what Good Charlotte are all about and hints at where\nthey are headed in the future.\n\nWhile musical trends can be fleeting, Good Charlotte have always proved\nthemselves to be a constant in the music world by sticking to their punk roots\nwithout being afraid to expand their horizons and bring in new influences - and\nCardiology is just the latest chapter in the band's already unparalleled career.\nWe can't wait to see what the second decade holds in store with Good Charlotte\nand share Cardiology with the band's myriad fans and supporters who have been\nclamoring for this record.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it?
