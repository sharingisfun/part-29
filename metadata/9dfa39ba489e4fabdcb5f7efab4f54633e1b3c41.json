Driven to provide what few others seemed to be doing, Shrapnel pooled their myriad influences and came up with a sound that revolves around formidable core of pure-to-the-bone thrash and speed metal, but that never fails to keep one eye on the future of the genre too. Proudly citing the likes of Megadeth, Slayer, Testament and Exodus as influences, the band have also assimilated elements of everything from traditional heavy metal to modern death metal. The result is a thrilling lesson in neck-wrecking sonic violence.Proudly outstripping all of their past studio efforts, ShrapnelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album The Virus Conspires is simply one of the most potent and convincing thrash metal albums the UK has ever produced. Fast, furious and utterly uncompromising, songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Titan,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“BraindeadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red TerrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ combine the very best of thrash metalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic components with a fresh and exhilarating air of electric intensity that could only come from a young and hungry band that are out for blood and glory. Mercilessly precise and violent but infused with an irresistible sense of muscular groove, this is 21st century thrash metal of the highest order. From the explosive riff attack of opener Kingdom Come through to the ominous might of the title track (which features a voiceover by Metal Hammer journalist and Oaf frontman Dom Lawson, who also contributes backing vocals elsewhere on the album) and on to the savage thrust of the closing Ã¢â‚¬Å“All That We KnowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, The Virus Conspires is an absolute monster that will surely propel Shrapnel to the top of the British metal heap when it is released in the winter of 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dfa39ba489e4fabdcb5f7efab4f54633e1b3c41","amp;dn":"Shrapnel+-+The+Virus+Conspires+++320k++mp3+++++++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dfa39ba489e4fabdcb5f7efab4f54633e1b3c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,250,57,186,72,158,79,171,220,181,247,239,171,79,84,99,62,27,60,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
