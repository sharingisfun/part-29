The word intellivision \n  is a portmanteau of &quot;intelligent television&quot;. Over 3 million Intellivision \n  units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console.\n\n* Intellivision can be considered the first 16-bit game console, \n  as the registers in the microprocessor, where the mathematical logic \n  is processed, are 16 bits wide. It can however be considered a 10-bit system \n  because the CPU's instruction set and game cartridges are 10 bits wide.\n\n* The Intellivision was also the first system to feature downloadable games. \n  Although, without a storage device the games vanished once the machine was \n  turned off. In 1981, General Instrument teamed up with Mattel to roll out the \n  PlayCable, a device that allowed the downloading of Intellivision games \n  via cable TV.\n\n* Intellivision was the first game console to provide real-time human and robot \n  voices in the middle of gameplay, courtesy of the IntelliVoice module.\n  The voice chip used, the SP0256 Orator, was developed jointly by Mattel\n  and General Instrument.\n\n* Intellivision was the first console to feature a controller with a\n  directional pad that allowed 16 directions. The disc-shaped pad allowed\n  players to control action without lifting the thumb and was considered by\n  many Intellivision users to be a useful innovation. However, the ergonomics\n  of the &quot;action&quot; buttons on the side of the controller were poor, and the\n  disc-pad was perceived by potential buyers as unfamiliar. Along with cost,\n  this was one of the factors in making the Intellivision less popular than \n  the Atari 2600. However, it is interesting to note that the method of\n  controlling movement on the Intellivision, with the thumb, is emulated in \n  many subsequent video game controllers. The joystick-style controller, as \n  seen on the VCS, has not been widely emulated on later consoles.\n  A third-party joystick attachment was available by around 1984,\n  that was installed by opening the controller and fitting the paddle over\n  the disc. A flange around the hollow plastic conical joystick held it in\n  securely when the controller's upper cover was replaced; and a much easier\n  joystick control was the result. The Joystick was about three inches in\n  height; it could not be gripped by the entire hand.\n\n* The Intellivision was also the first game console or home computer to offer\n  a musical synthesizer keyboard. The Music Synthesizer keyboard was designed\n  as a secondary add-on for the ECS, and was intended to lead to a series of\n  music-oriented software titles for both educational and entertainment\n  purposes, but only one title, Melody Blaster, was ever released.\n\n\n  The 1980s saw the dawn of the home video game system. One of the most\n  popular was INTELLIVISION - Intelligent Television! During its ten-year run,\n  Intellivision sold more than 3 million game players and 10 million game\n  cartridges. It became the favorite of many gamers who still long to play\n  these games today - 30 years later! Rediscover what the frenzy was all\n  about: these pioneering games, with their simple, blocky graphics, are as\n  fun and addictive today as they were back then!\n\n  * Plays actual game code from original Intellivision cartridges on your PC\n  * 10 original games including: Astrosmash, Night Stalker, Shark! Shark!,\n    Las Vegas Poker &amp; Blackjack, Snafu, Space Armada, Skiing, Motocross,\n    Super Pro Wrestling, &amp; Super Pro Football.\n\n xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n                                [ R O M S ]\n  \nAll ROMs compatible / 123 rom tested\n\n    * 4-TRIS (2001) (Joseph Zbiciak).int\n    * Air Strike (1982) (Mattel).int\n    * Astrosmash (1981) (Mattel).int\n    * Auto Racing (1979) (Mattel).int\n    * BeamRider (1983) (Activision).int\n    * Blockade Runner (1983) (Interphase).int\n    * Body_Slam_Wrestling.itv\n    * Brickout!
