Casually known by historians as the &quot;Rape of Nanking,&quot; the relentless assault on the then-Chinese capitol found countless men, women, and children slaughtered with a ferocity that shocked the entire world. Yet, despite the violence that surrounded them, some people refused to sit by silently as the innocents perished. One of those people was German engineer and Nazi party member John Rabe, who earned the nickname &quot;The Schindler of China&quot; for constructing a vast safety zone in which nearly a quarter of a million civilians sought sanctuary. Ulrich Tukur, Daniel BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hl, Dagmar Manzel, and Steve Buscemi star. \n\nIMDB:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124377/\n\nLanguage: Cantonese / Mandarin / German / Japanese / English / Ukrainian\nSubtitles: English and Brazilian Portuguese\n\nFile Name .........................................: John.Rabe.2009.480p.BRRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,350,700,544 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:14:26\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x304 (AR: 2.368)\nFPS .................................................: 24.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1877 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.357 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c1b2e36492b943d1847914fb708fcf5f9888fd9","amp;dn":"John+Rabe+%282009%29+-+480p.BRRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c1b2e36492b943d1847914fb708fcf5f9888fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,27,46,54,73,43,148,61,24,71,145,79,183,8,252,245,249,136,143,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
