The innocent but watchful Olivia develops an infatuation for her headmistress, Mlle. Julie, and through this screen of love observes the tense romance between Mlle. Julie and the other head of the school, Mlle. Cara, in its final months.\n\nAlthough not strictly autobiographical, Olivia draws on the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences at finishing schools run by the charismatic Mlle. Marie Souvestre, whose influence lived on through former students like Natalie Barney and Eleanor Roosevelt. Olivia was dedicated to the memory of StracheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend Virginia Woolf and published to acclaim in 1949. Colette wrote the screenplay for the 1951 film adaptation of the novel. In 1999, Olivia was included on the Publishing TriangleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widely publicized list of the 100 Best Gay and Lesbian Novels of the 20th Century.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90529e9330334561658a4a61fae3b057918a7964","amp;dn":"Olivia+%28Dorothy+Strachey%29+Retail+epub+mobi+PDF+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90529e9330334561658a4a61fae3b057918a7964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,82,158,147,48,51,69,97,101,138,74,97,250,227,176,87,145,138,121,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
