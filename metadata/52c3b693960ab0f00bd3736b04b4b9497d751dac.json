On  the  following  pages  I'll  \nshow  you   some   real   molecules   that   have   unusual,   ridiculous   or  \ndownright  silly  names.    Some  of  the  molecule  names  are  bizarre,  \nsome  make  you  wonder  how  supposedly  serious  scientists  could  \npossibly have called a molecule that, and some are very rude indeed!    \n            \n          Although  the  object  of  this  book  is  mainly  entertainment,  \nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried to include a fair bit of science along the way, along with  \nthe  references  if  you  want  to  check  that  I  didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t  make  it  all  up!   \nMost of the molecules have their full structure shown, and with some  \nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve included brief facts about their history and what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re used  \nfor.  As well as molecules, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also included some of my favourites  \nfrom  the  vast  number  of  minerals,  proteins  and  genes  that  have  \noften  accidentally  (or  deliberately!)  been  given  ludicrous  names.   \nDespite  the  humorous  and  often  irreverent  nature  of  the  content,  \nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m hoping that the reader might unknowingly pick up quite a bit of  \nchemistry along the way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ learning chemistry Ã¢â‚¬Ëœby stealthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, as it were.  \n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52c3b693960ab0f00bd3736b04b4b9497d751dac","amp;dn":"Paul+W+May+-+Molecules+With+Silly+Or+Unusual+Names","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52c3b693960ab0f00bd3736b04b4b9497d751dac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,195,182,147,150,10,176,240,11,211,115,107,4,180,185,73,125,117,29,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
