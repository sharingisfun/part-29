The track list is basically a who's-who of early 90s hip hop, with Ice-T, Ice Cube, Public Enemy, Gang Starr, Black Sheep, WC &amp; the Maad Circle and more. \nNot every artist contributes their best song, but the title cut (featuring a match made heaven between Cube and Ice-T) is short, snappy and extremely funky, the Black Sheep cut is great, and even Sir Mix-a-lot delivers a decent offering. \nDon't worry if you haven't seen (or heard of) the movie, check out the soundtrack anyway.
