Presumably, the &quot;old-school jazz&quot;\nthat Mitchell is referring to is post-bop, while &quot;the never-never land&quot; is\navant-garde jazz. Of course, avant-garde jazz comes in many different\nflavors. Avant-garde jazz can be totally outside (whether it is scorching,\ndense, brutally atonal free jazz or the spaciness of the AACM), or it can be\navant-garde jazz with an inside/outside perspective--and Awakening, like\nprevious Mitchell releases, has an inside/outside perspective. The material\nthat Mitchell composed for Awakening is fairly melodic; &quot;There,&quot; &quot;Momentum&quot; and\nthe bluesy &quot;F.O.C.,&quot; for example, offer appealing post-bop melodies. &quot;Curly\nTop&quot; even has a somewhat Horace Silver-ish funkiness. So no, this 64-minute CD\nis not an exercise in atonality; that isn't the scenario at all. But at the\nsame time, Mitchell and her colleagues don't hesitate to venture into outside\nplaying when they feel like it. They don't venture far outside, but they do\nventure outside--and while Awakening is more inside than outside, the outside\nelement is an attractive part of the equation. Mitchell, it should be noted,\nhas favored different combinations of musicians on different albums; she is\nquite proficient when it comes to ensemble playing and arranging, but an\nintimate quartet format serves her equally well on Awakening. And once again,\nthe Chicago resident excels as both a composer and a soloist.\n\n--\n\nBy Nic Jones &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=41115&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=41115&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD36/PoD36MoreMoments5.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD36/PoD36MoreMoments5.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nDi Enrico Bettinello (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=7155&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=7155&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Pachi Tapiz (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=2595&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=2595&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c9a1ff511c57e6bf2cc0a1aadf41693c794c0e7","amp;dn":"Nicole+Mitchell+-+Awakening+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c9a1ff511c57e6bf2cc0a1aadf41693c794c0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,154,31,245,17,197,126,107,242,204,10,26,173,244,22,147,199,148,192,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
