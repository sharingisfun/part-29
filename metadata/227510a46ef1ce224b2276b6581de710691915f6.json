Taco's debut LP, After Eight, contained other recreations of 1930s hits, as well as original material in the same vein; however, the market for such stuff was clearly limited, and after a 1984 follow-up, Let's Face the Music, he disappeared from the charts for good. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:227510a46ef1ce224b2276b6581de710691915f6","amp;dn":"Taco+-+After+Eight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"227510a46ef1ce224b2276b6581de710691915f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,117,16,164,110,241,206,34,75,34,118,182,88,29,231,16,105,25,21,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
