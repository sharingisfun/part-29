He obviously sees himself as a big deal about town, and he's got the spending habits to prove it, including payments on a big house and a fancy Jaguar. His unstable life is further complicated by the fling he's having with the station's lotto girl (Lisa Kudrow), who is also having an affair with the married station manager (Ed O'Neill). On the verge of bankruptcy, Russ asks the advice of his good friend and strip club owner Gig (Tim Roth), who cooks up a plan to fix the lottery. The hardest part of the whole scheme turns out to be finding a trustworthy person to cash in the ticket.\n\n  Starring: John Travolta, Lisa Kudrow, Tim Roth, Ed O'Neill, Michael Rapaport.\n\n  Directed by: Nora Ephron.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 46min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 368\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd2b3124b66317dccd9d3723712761a26e39215","amp;dn":"Lucky+Numbers+%282000%29+%28John+Travolta%2C+Lisa+Kudrow%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd2b3124b66317dccd9d3723712761a26e39215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,210,179,18,75,102,49,125,204,217,211,114,55,18,118,26,38,227,146,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
