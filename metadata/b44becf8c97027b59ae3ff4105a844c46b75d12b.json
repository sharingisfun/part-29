Steve Osborne is the real deal, people: the tough, streetwise New York cop of your dreams, one with a big, big heart. Kojak? NYPD Blue? Law &amp; Order? Fuggedaboudem! The Job blows them out of the water.\r\n\r\nSteve Osborne has seen a thing or two in his years in the NYPDâ€”some harmless, some definitely not. In â€œStakeout,â€ Steve and his partner mistake a Manhattan dentist for an armed robbery suspect, and reduce the man to a puddle of snot and tears when questioning him. In â€œMug Shot,â€ the mother of a suspected criminal makes a strange request and provides a sobering reminder of the humanity at stake in his profession. And in â€œHome,â€ the image of Steveâ€™s family provides the adrenaline he needs to fight for his life when assaulted by two armed and violent crackheads. \r\n\r\nFrom stories about his days as a rookie cop to the time spent patrolling in the Anti-Crime Unitâ€”and his visceral, harrowing recollections of working during the weeks after 9/11â€”The Job: True Tales from the Life of a New York City Cop captures the humanity, the absurdity, and the dark humor of police work, as well as the bravery of those who do it. These stories will speak to those nostalgic for the New York City of the 1980s and â€™90s, a bygone era when the city was a crazier, more dangerous (and possibly more interesting) place","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b44becf8c97027b59ae3ff4105a844c46b75d12b","amp;dn":"The+Job+-+Steve+Osborne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b44becf8c97027b59ae3ff4105a844c46b75d12b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,75,236,248,201,112,39,181,154,227,255,65,5,168,68,196,107,117,209,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
