Excellent album for blues lovers. The magic between these two artists comes together consistently in a traditonal style of blues. Snooky Prior provides excellent vocals and harmonica playing while the modest Mel Brown shows his magic on the guitar while not getting enough credit for his vocal skills as well.\n\nWhat makes this release so damn good is the relaxed manner in which it was cut. The in-studio banter between the two principals that is heard throughout creates a fun atmosphere that is transcribed to the lucky listener over the course of the 12. Double Shot is the blues the way it was meant to be played by two fellas who hold a masters degree in the subject. Be forewarned - listening to this album is extremely habit forming and may cause an irresistible urge to play it repeatedly. This one really cooks!...' ~~ by Steve Hinrichsen.\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
