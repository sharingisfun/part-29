Codecs are ASF and filenames are in Korean.  If anyone wishes, I will also seed an iPod version (which is much more appropriate on-the-go).\n\nFor a preview, search Youtube for &quot;Let's Speak Korean - Season 2&quot;\n\nI downloaded this from a Korean site and I'm not responsible for the poor quality codec or audio clicks.  Lisa Kelley is some pretty, though.\n\nThe show is currently in Season 4 on Arirang and you can even see some videos on-demand at their site.  I'm not sure I love this show and I will share it only as long as I see fit, so if you want it, get it now...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:787ff987f555e9a2112729ea51be3bc85993f430","amp;dn":"Let%5C%27s+Speak+Korean+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"787ff987f555e9a2112729ea51be3bc85993f430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,127,249,135,245,85,233,162,17,39,41,234,81,190,59,200,89,147,244,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
