The songs made many success in the Netherlands, and all five singles had peaked in the top 10. &quot;Lessons in Love&quot; peak in #1 in Germany, South Africa, Switzerland and Denmark. This was the last Level 42 album of 1980's to feature brothers Phil (drums) and Rowland 'Boon' Gould (guitar), who had cited dissatisfaction with the musical direction of the band, and exhaustion as departure reasons.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Lessons In Love\n[02] Children Say\n[03] Running In The Family\n[04] It's Over\n[05] To Be With You Again\n[06] Two Solitudes\n[07] Fashion Fever\n[08] The Sleepwalkers\n[09] Freedom Someday\n \n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:49m:14s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 119mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploade\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 1987\nRecord Company\t&gt; Polydor\nArtist Website\t&gt;\n\n&gt; http://www.level42.com \n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_42 \n&gt; http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/level_42_lyrics_7336/ \n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/level42 \n&gt;\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55fa638b2f457b54bb6579da3d425eba15cf693c","amp;dn":"%5B1987%5D+Running+In+The+Family+-+Level+42+-+119mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1j","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55fa638b2f457b54bb6579da3d425eba15cf693c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,250,99,139,47,69,123,84,187,101,121,218,61,66,94,186,21,207,105,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
