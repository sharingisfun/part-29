It not only has C/DVD-simulation function, \nit also has the function of recording the C/DVD image file to a\nblank C/DVD if you have a C/DVD recorder. The combination of the\n&quot;C/DVD simulation&quot; software and the &quot;burner&quot; software not only\nsave the space on HDD, but also makes you manage more easily.\n          \n\n          CD/DVD simulation engine\n\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Fantom DVD, with its powerful simulation function, can simulate\n          the complete content of the original C/DVD and allow you to use\n          the content of the C/DVD under various environments  without\n          recording the C/DVD image file first. In addition, Fantom DVD\n          also supports multiple formats of the C/DVD image file so you\n          can directly mount the C/DVD image file made by the other\n          software to the virtual C/DVD-ROM drive and read it. \n\n\n        Burner engine \n\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· You can use this software to record the C/DVD image file\n          directly to a blank C/DVD-ROM without using the other burner\n          software, so you can manage the C/DVD image files more easily.\n\n\n        What is a Fantom DVD\n\n        The virtual C/DVD-ROM software simulates the functionality of the\n        C/DVD-ROM drive on your computer by using the computer simulation\n        technology. You can use it as a real C/DVD-ROM drive. The tasks\n        performed by a normal C/DVD-ROM drive can be done by the virtual\n        C/DVD-ROM drive. In addition, the virtual C/DVD-ROM drive has\n        many easy-use functions which a normal C/DVD-ROM drive doesn&amp;#039;t\n        have. For example, it does not require inserting a C/DVD-ROM in\n        the C/DVD-ROM drive when run the program, so you don&amp;#039;t need to\n        bring a lot of C/DVD with you when using it. In addition, the\n        virtual drive has faster processing speed than a real C/DVD-ROM\n        drive. Furthermore, using C/DVD-ROM drive simulation software can\n        also well serve the purpose of preserving the original C/DVD\n        (because it might cause scratches on the C/DVD when regularly \n        inserting and removing it as well as during the C/DVD-ROM drive\n        reading operation).\n\n        After successful installation of Fantom C/DVD software, the user\n        will see one or multiple virtual C/DVD-ROM drives shown on the\n        Windows system, and like a real C/DVD-ROM drive, you can see it\n        in My Computer, File Explorer, or the other applications, even in\n        the Device Manager. You can use it as real C/DVD-ROM drive. \n  \n\n        Operation System:\n\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Fantom DVD support Winodws x86 Edition(NT/2K/XP/2003/XP Table\n          PC/Table PC 2005/Vista) and Winodws x64 Edition(XP/2003/Vista). \n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· There is no language limitation for the series of Microsoft OS. \n \n        HDD:\n\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The required space of the HDD depends on the size of the image\n          file. \n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Fantom DVD program only needs less then 5 MB space. \n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· It will not increase the required space for the HDD when\n          increasing the number of virtual   C/DVD-ROM drive. Therefore,\n          if you are to make multiple image files, it is recommended to\n          save some space for these files. \n\n        C/DVD-ROM:\n\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Any C/DVD-ROM drive that can be detected by Fantom DVD. The\n          C/DVD-ROM drive is mainly used for making the C/DVD image. \n          However, if the speed of the CD-ROM drive is slower, then it\n          takes more time to make a C/DVD image.\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW/+R/+RW/RAM (optional):\n          It is required only if you want to record the C/DVD image to\n          the C/DVD-ROM.\n\n\n        Emulation:\n\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Ignore Media Type\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· BAD Sectors Emulation (Safedisc)\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Sub-Channel Data Fixed &amp; Emulation (Secu-Rom/Starforce)\n        Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Laserlock Emulation\n\n\n \n        For More Info On Fantom DVD Professional Visit:\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.fantomdvd.com]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.fantomdvd.com]&lt;/a&gt;\n\nlike deamon tools and alcolhol 120%\n\nPlease seed \n\nDotcom1\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:313b75fb27a89526485b7ebf39e46cee82cbc18b","amp;dn":"Fantom.DVD.Professional.v1.8.8.19%7BDotcom1%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"313b75fb27a89526485b7ebf39e46cee82cbc18b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,59,117,251,39,168,149,38,72,91,126,191,57,228,108,238,130,203,193,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
