Brad Lane and Neill Robertson became friends growing up in Mobile, Alabama, then jammed in high school when they should have been studying. They played together in several bands before traveling to Germany and deciding that The Volks (The People) might work if they could find the right guys for bass player and drummer. With Nick Campbell joining the group on bass, and Freddie Blache on percussion, the result is their first album released after numerous gigs that honed their sound, influenced by everyone from The Beatles to The Everly Brothers, The Strokes to classic Southern Rock. Can't-stop-moving would be the sound they create, always lively, looking for a good time wherever some amps and enough room to play can be found. You might catch a breath on a couple of tracks, but don't rest long, because The Volks mean to get you off your ass.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6037cc89b0a1d7d9ddf1664abf6dc61de4b15111","amp;dn":"The+Volks+-+The+Volks+%5BEP%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6037cc89b0a1d7d9ddf1664abf6dc61de4b15111","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,55,204,137,176,161,215,217,221,241,102,74,191,109,198,29,228,177,81,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
