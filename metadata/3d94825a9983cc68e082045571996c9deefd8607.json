First is much better YouTube support in player. We added ability to subscribe to channels, like and dislike video, load video description and YouTube comments, give you ability to comment video etc.\r\n\r\nAlso every YouTube category has now 200 &quot;trending&quot; videos, &quot;live&quot; videos and ability to select region.\r\n\r\nIn YouTube &quot;Subscriptions&quot; you can find new videos related to subscribed channels.\r\n\r\n2. Second is completely re-built communication player UI with playback engine, fixed possible crashes and memory leaks, added ability for you to use system codecs for reading files, decode audio and video instead of built-in player codecs.\r\n\r\nFor example if you think that some external codecs installed in your system will play Twitch or YouTube streams better then you can say player to use these system codecs to play streams.\r\n\r\nAlso you can disable hardware acceleration for some videos if you want.\r\n\r\n3. Third is adding new features like setup video aspect ratio and geometry (size and position), setup playback rate.\r\n\r\nA lot of efforts we spent on optimizing UI performance, fixing different bugs in UI, improving hot keys work.\r\n\r\nProbably you will value also new player feature - support panel with YouTube comments and Twitch chat in fullscreen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d94825a9983cc68e082045571996c9deefd8607","amp;dn":"CherryPlayer+2.4.0+%2B+portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d94825a9983cc68e082045571996c9deefd8607","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,148,130,90,153,131,204,104,224,130,4,85,113,153,108,157,238,253,134,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
