Its prize is ridiculously high, with a limited use of four lisences, each one per computer. With a tedious activation process and continuous updates, the program costs $995.00 (plus taxes and shipping and  whatever else) for a windows xp home lisence and around $1500.00 (or something similar, plus taxing and whatever else) for a pro/vista lisence. additionally, for &quot;extra&quot; protection, a cd which lets you &quot;authorize&quot; your copy ships witht he original package. On top of this, if you haven&amp;#039;t kept up with the upgrades, they will decide to charge you about $200.00 for the MSA. As a precaution no one should run updates with versions like these.\n\nInstructions\n\nThis is the latest version of jaws as of current writing 4/20/2008 (Happy Stoner Day!)\nInstall the demo file.\n\ncopy the two files jfw.exe and hjook.dll to the \nC:Program FilesFreedom Scientificjaws9.0 folder replacing the two files that were there;\nthen go back two levels up to the Freedom Scientific directory and delete the activator folder, usually at:\nC:Program FilesFreedom ScientificActivator\n\nReboot the system\n\nEnjoy\n\nNote: If you use a screen reader, Use windows narrator or similar so as you can delete the original jfw.exe and jhook.dll files and replace them.\n\nPackage updated and instructions fixed, original instructions below.\n\n-----\nOriginal instructions\n------\n\nHi all,\n\nspecial thanks go out to whoever programmed and made this available.\nWe have been looking for something like this for quite a while, and now it is there.\nTo support spreading it, there is a file called jaws 9.0.552 rus + crack + TTS Engines.rar on file sharing networks.\nPlease continue providing the original file for the convenience of other people to download, or provide alternative methods of making it available.\nThe original file is about 184 MB in size, and it contains many TTS voices for the Russian language, as well as the russian installation file for  JAWS 9.0. I just stripped the crack from there to provide a better way of getting it to those with slow or limited internet access.\n\nRumours go that a Service Pack of JAWS is soon to be released, so if anyone out there has programming knowledge, PLEASE consider using it to update this marvelous patch or program something similar to continue supporting the blind community.\n\nThe installation procedure is that of patches already available on the net.\nJust replace the jfw.exe and jhook.dll files in the installation directory of JAWS 9.0.552 with those provided in this archive. The directory usually is: c:programm filesfreedom scientificjaws9.0, the programm files folder may have a different name under non-english versions of windows.\n\nThe original text in Russian states that one should remove the activator1.1 folder, I suppose this is for convenience only, to not hear the activation dialogue every time JAWS is started.\nI tested it without deleting the directory, and it also works.\n\nThe original text in Russian follows below.\nEnjoy!\n\nÃƒË†ÃƒÂ­ÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ²ÃƒÂ°ÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂªÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ¨ÃƒÂ¿ ÃƒÂ¯ÃƒÂ® ÃƒÂ¯ÃƒÂ°ÃƒÂ¨ÃƒÂ¬ÃƒÂ¥ÃƒÂ­ÃƒÂ¥ÃƒÂ­ÃƒÂ¨ÃƒÂ¾:\n\n1.
