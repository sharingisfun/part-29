While mostly backed by Bretheren rhythm section Stu Woods and Rick Marotta, Kooper also utilized groups in Nashville and Los Angeles to record the tracks for the album.\n\nTwo tracks were also featured on the soundtrack to the counter-culture film The Landlord, &quot;Brand New Day&quot; and &quot;Love Theme from The Landlord&quot;.\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Brand New Day&quot; (Al Kooper) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n   2. &quot;Piano Solo Introduction to I Got a Woman&quot; (2:00)\n   3. &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; (Ray Charles, Renald Richard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n   4. &quot;Country Road&quot; (James Taylor) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n   5. &quot;I Bought You The Shoes (You're Walking Away In)&quot; (Bob Brass, Irwin Levine, Kooper) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:57\n   6. &quot;Introduction&quot; (0:50)\n   7. &quot;Easy Does It&quot; (Kooper) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n   8. &quot;Buckskin Boy&quot; (Kooper, Charlie Calello) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n   9. &quot;Love Theme from The Landlord&quot; (Kooper) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n  10. &quot;Sad, Sad Sunshine&quot; (Kooper) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04\n  11. &quot;Let the Duchess No&quot; (John Gregory, Jim Roberts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n  12. &quot;She Gets Me Where I Live&quot; (Kooper, Calello) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n  13. &quot;A Rose and a Baby Ruth&quot; (J.D.
