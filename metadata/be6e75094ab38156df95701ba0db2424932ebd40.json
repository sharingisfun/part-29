The producer and\n\n     director, Judd Apatow and Greg Motolla loved the\n\n     juxtaposition of these two white high school kids and\n\n     this funky music; it just worked on a myriad of\n\n     levels. The composer, Lyle Workman and music\n\n     supervisor, Jonathan Karp agreed that the original\n\n     music be as authentic as possible in order to sound as\n\n     soulful and greasy as the songs and score music that\n\n     had been temped in as inspiration. This path toward\n\n     authenticity dictated that the musicians were the\n\n     originators and innovators -- the most influential\n\n     names synonymous with Funk. With sights set on soul\n\n     royalty, the team set out going after the alumni of\n\n     James Brown&amp;#039;s band. Bootsy Collins, Mr. Brown&amp;#039;s\n\n     groundbreaking bassist before joining George Clinton\n\n     and Parliament Funkadelic, was the first on board.\n\n     Nabbed next was the funkiest of funky drummers, Clyde\n\n     Stubblefield and John &quot;Jab&amp;#039;o&quot; Starks, both heard on\n\n     Mr. Brown&amp;#039;s most popular songs. Adding Phelps\n\n     &quot;Catfish&quot; Collins on guitar and keyboard genius Bernie\n\n     Worrell, the dream band had been assembled. Because\n\n     they had not seen each other in years, the spirit in\n\n     the studio was very much a family reunion and\n\n     something to behold. In the end, what was achieved\n\n     from this joyous congregation far exceeded the\n\n     expectations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6e75094ab38156df95701ba0db2424932ebd40","amp;dn":"Superbad+OST+%282007%29+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6e75094ab38156df95701ba0db2424932ebd40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,110,117,9,74,179,129,86,223,149,112,27,160,219,36,36,147,46,189,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
