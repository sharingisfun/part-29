On her Contemporary CD, Sloane holds her own with some illustrious sidemen (flugelhornist Art Farmer, tenor saxophonist Clifford Jordan, guitarist Kenny Burrell, pianist Kenny Barron, bassist Rufus Reid and drummer Akira Tana); her two duets with Burrell (&quot;I Wish I'd Met You&quot; and &quot;For All We Know&quot;) are among the high points, along with &quot;Love You Madly,&quot; &quot;That Old Devil Called Love&quot; and &quot;Getting Some Fun Out of Life.&quot; This is a strong effort that finds Carol Sloane in prime form. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Love You Madly\n02 - I Could Have Told You So\n03 - My Gentleman Friend\n04 - For All We Know\n05 - While We're Young\n06 - Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\n07 - That Old Devil Called Love\n08 - I'm Glad There Is You\n09 - I Wish I'd Met You\n10 - Someday You'll Be Sorry\n11 - Inside a Silent Tear\n12 - Getting Some Fun Out of Life\n13 - My Foolish Heart\n\nEnjoy and share!
