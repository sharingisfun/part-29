In Roundabout, players drive passengers in a constantly revolving limousine to their destinations.\n\nSet in 1977, Roundabout tells the rise to fame story of Georgio Manos, arguably the world's most famous revolving chauffeur. While driving around the town of Roundabout, players can pick up passengers, compete in challenges, find hidden collectables, customize their limousine, purchase property, and much, much more!\n\nRoundabout's cutting edge full motion video technology allows us to put real actors in the back seat! Watch as Georgio Manos (played by Kate Welch) drives an all-star cast to their destinations.\n\n(I am not the owner of this torrent)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec81d30708bc2f8c7b401094b30eabbda164b86","amp;dn":"Roundabout+%5B3DM%5D+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ec81d30708bc2f8c7b401094b30eabbda164b86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,200,29,48,112,139,194,248,199,180,1,9,75,48,234,187,218,22,75,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
