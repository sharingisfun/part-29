Looking at DeerhunterÃƒÂ¢??s past tour itineraries only drives my point home like a tent stake into damp ground ÃƒÂ¢?? Bradford CoxÃƒÂ¢??s troops have been tamped beneath/coupled with acts big and small, from Smashing Pumpkins to The Ponys to Grizzly Bear. With a new version of Cryptograms out that includes the fantastic Flourescent Grey EP ÃƒÂ¢?? not to mention a much-circulated risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-rock pic of Bradford getting his Coxucked ONSTAGE (by a dude no less) ÃƒÂ¢?? I canÃƒÂ¢??t think of a single reason Deerhunter wouldnÃƒÂ¢??t at least draw mild curiosity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:119c94711867d12203d850c333c48503b08e3b7d","amp;dn":"Deerhunter+%7E+Cryptograms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"119c94711867d12203d850c333c48503b08e3b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,156,148,113,24,103,209,34,3,216,80,195,51,196,133,3,176,142,59,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
