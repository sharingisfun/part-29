TeamViewer establishes connections to any PC or server all around the world within just a few seconds.\n\nFeatures:\n=========\n\nOne solution for everything\n\nWhile most competitors offer different packages for remote support, remote administration, training and sales (and also charge for them...) TeamViewer is the one-stop solution for everything you need: TeamViewer includes all modules in one simple and very affordable package.\n\nRemote administration of unattended servers\n\nTeamViewer can also be used to control unattended computers and servers. System service installations even allow remote reboot and reconnect.\n\nFile transfer\n\nTeamViewer comes with integrated file transfer that allows you to copy files and folders to and from a remote partner - which also works behind firewalls\n\nHighest security standard\n\nTeamViewer is a very secure solution. All versions feature completely secure data channels with key exchange and AES (256 Bit) session encoding, the same security standard used by https/SSL.\n\nOnline status display\n\nAre your team members in many different locations? Need to present your desktop or collaborate on a document? In the TeamViewer partner list you can see who is available and connect with them in one mouse click.\n\nRemote support without installation\n\nWith TeamViewer you can remotely control any PC anywhere on the Internet. No installation is required, just run the application on both sides and connect - even through tight firewalls.\n\nRemote presentation of products, solutions and services\n\nTeamViewer allows you to present your desktop to a partner. Share live demos, products, and presentations over the Internet within seconds.\n\nWorks behind firewalls\n\nThe major difficulties in using remote control software are firewalls and blocked ports, as well as NAT routing for local IP addresses.\nIf you use TeamViewer you don't have to worry about firewalls: TeamViewer will find a route to your partner.\n\nBrowser based access\n\nOn the road and need to control a remote computer? Why don't you use TeamViewer Web Connector? The purely html and flash based solution can be used from nearly any browser and operating system.\n\nVery competitively priced, free versions available\n\nTeamViewer offers great value for low prices. TeamViewer even offers a free version for non-commercial use.\n\nOptimized performance\n\nWhether you have a LAN or dial-up connection, TeamViewer optimizes display quality and speed depending on your network connection.\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\nFor anyone WHO MAY HAVE issues with installation, extraction, wrong file extensions, passwords etc for this or any of my other installer torrents. Go to:\n\nStart-Computer-Documents-Organize-Folder and search options-View\n\nThen from the scroll menu that appears, un-tick the option of &quot;Hide extensions for known file types&quot;.

Return to your downloaded installer torrent of mine and change the file extension to .exe\n\nThen right click on it and select &quot;Run as administrator&quot;. \n\nNONE of my torrents are, or ever have been passworded or have any other type of security, re-directs etc on them.\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\n-nelly- home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!\n\n             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor re-seed requests, help, support or anything else relating to The Pirate Bay.
