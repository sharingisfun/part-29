Check the included changelog.txt file for a list of changes.\n\n--\n\nCombining action and strategy in a unique way, Sang-Froid: Tales of\nWerewolves transports you into an epic folktale co-written with\nbest-selling Canadian author Bryan Perro (Amos Daragon, Wariwulf),\nin which two feuding brothers will have to put aside their\ndifferences to save their sister, who is pursued by the Devil\nhimself!\n\nThis time however, sheer brute strength wont be enough to save the\nday as your enemies are way stronger than you are. Only your wits\nand the ability to combine ingenious traps to setup deadly ambushes\nwill give you a chance to see the sun rise again on your frozen\npiece of forest...\n\n\n       1.
