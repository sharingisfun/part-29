Ballard, first published as a pamphlet by the Unicorn Bookshop, Brighton, in 1968.It was later collected in The Atrocity Exhibition.\n\nIt is written in the style of a scientific paper and catalogues an apocryphal series of bizarre experiments intended to measure the psychosexual appeal of Ronald Reagan, who was then the Governor of California and candidate for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination.\n\n==============\nJames Graham &quot;J. G.&quot; Ballard (15 November 1930 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 19 April 2009) was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist.\n\nBallard came to be associated with the New Wave of science fiction early in his career with apocalyptic (or post-apocalyptic) novels such as The Drowned World (1962), The Burning World (1964), and The Crystal World (1966). In the late 1960s and early 1970s Ballard focused on an eclectic variety of short stories (or &quot;condensed novels&quot;) such as The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), which drew closer comparison with the work of postmodernist writers such as William S. Burroughs. \n\nThe literary distinctiveness of Ballard's work has given rise to the adjective &quot;Ballardian&quot;, defined by the Collins English Dictionary as &quot;resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in J. G. Ballard's novels and stories, especially dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments.&quot; The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry describes Ballard's work as being occupied with &quot;eros, thanatos, mass media and emergent technologies&quot;.\n=====================\nPart of JG Ballard Collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:325fcee3b5de04eb6e0be8e8501d76128e05727d","amp;dn":"Why+I+Want+to+Fuck+Ronald+Reagan+by+J+G+Ballard+%28PDF%2CAnnotated%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"325fcee3b5de04eb6e0be8e8501d76128e05727d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,95,206,227,181,222,4,235,110,11,232,232,80,29,118,18,142,5,114,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
