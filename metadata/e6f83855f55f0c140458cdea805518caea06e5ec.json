For many people, it's far more complicated than that, and Dr. Joy Browne addresses those complexities in Dating for Dummies. Exactly how do you meet a potential date? How do you present yourself in the most favorable light? How do you negotiate that first date? (One interesting story Browne tells is of a couple who negotiated a weekend together, deciding whether or not they'd have sex, and under what conditions they'd consider marriage and children--all before their first date.) And how do you proceed from there? The process still comes down to chemistry, but Browne shows how many ways there are to make sure you get your best possible chance with Mr./Ms. Right.\n\nAuthor : Dr. Joy Browne\nPaperback: 433 pages\nPublisher: Wiley Publishing\nLanguage: English\nSource Files: Yes\nFormat: pdf\n[img]http://1337x.org/torrentimg-14653.png[/img]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f83855f55f0c140458cdea805518caea06e5ec","amp;dn":"Dating+for+Dummies-EBOOK+SHAREGO.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f83855f55f0c140458cdea805518caea06e5ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,248,56,85,245,95,12,20,4,88,205,234,128,85,24,202,234,6,229,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
