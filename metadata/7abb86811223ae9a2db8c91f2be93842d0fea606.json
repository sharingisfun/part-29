Band played increasingly weird death metal for two and a half years before adding Simpkins to the line-up and going instrumental. Recorded the Spatial/Design EP in Dec. 2002, which was promptly released the next year by North Carolina label Tribunal Records. In 2004, Canvas released their debut LP, Sublimation, again through the Tribunal label. In Feb. 2005, Canvas signed with Sensory Records (home to Spiral Architect, Gordian Knot, Zero Hour, et al.), who just released the bandÃƒÂ¢??s second full-length album,Penumbra Diffuse. Slaughtering, pillaging, and world domination to be released later this year.&quot;\n\nSource:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7abb86811223ae9a2db8c91f2be93842d0fea606","amp;dn":"Canvas+Solaris+-+The+Atomized+Dream+%282008%29+%28Prog%2FExperimental+me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7abb86811223ae9a2db8c91f2be93842d0fea606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,187,134,129,18,35,174,154,45,184,201,31,43,233,56,66,208,254,166,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
