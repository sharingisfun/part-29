Life should be perfect after he and Dervish got the better of the demon master, Lord Loss. But the battle has left its marks and Dervish is a haunted man. When an offer comes along to get involved in the making of a horror movie about demons, Dervish seizes it, hoping the change of scenery and challenge will help him clear his head of all the bad memories whirling around inside. To protect Grubbs and Bill-E from the sinister Lambs, he takes them with him, figuring they&amp;#039;re a lot safer with him than in Carcery Vale.\n\nWrong!!!!\n\nGrubbs enjoys life on the set of &quot;Slawter&quot; to begin with. But when a member of the cast vanishes after a gory death scene, Grubbs gets the feeling that the demons are real. Everyone mocks him, even Dervish, but as the bodies start to mount up, and Grubbs begins to tap into magic in the air, he becomes more convinced than ever that something foul is afoot. But even if he can persuade the others of the danger they&amp;#039;re in, is there any way out of the demonic web of &quot;Slawter&quot;??????","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b86cfc8a38da81a5fafdd1308586ef8b9c868bd6","amp;dn":"Darren+Shan+-+The+Demonata+Book+3+-+Slawter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b86cfc8a38da81a5fafdd1308586ef8b9c868bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,108,252,138,56,218,129,165,250,253,209,48,133,134,239,139,156,134,139,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
