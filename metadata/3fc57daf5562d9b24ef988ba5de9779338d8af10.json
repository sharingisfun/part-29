The song called lal pahari was not only sung by the bauls (wandering ministrels) but also by popular bands like Paraspathor and Bhoomi. The words went something like this:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/7848/lalpahari.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/7848/lalpahari.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThen after a while, some people claimed that this was not a folk song at all and that it was a creation of the poet Arun Chakraborty. Yet others claimed that they were the ones who set it to music. But behind all this, the song continued to hold eveyone in its sway.\n\nThis is the story of the song.\n\nScreens :\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/1885/ydbtitle.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/1885/ydbtitle.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/a5ac0d186235706&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/a5ac0d186235706&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/c12282186235846&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/c12282186235846&lt;/a&gt;\n\nComments:\n\nThe best part of the documentary is that it pays less attention to the controversy and dwells instead on the song itself and the variations that have come up. It shows how hill people across the world have structured their songs on similar metrics and in the process it is a delight for the ears. You don't have to be a Bengali to enjoy this documentary. You only need to love folk music.\n\nUploader's Notes:\nThe film is in Black and white. I love playing with black and white video and the results, I think, show that. The rip has come out in excellent detail and even on a large screen there is almost no deterioration in the picture.\n\nThis will be the last rip I will upload for a very long time as I relocate and move to another part of the country. It is therefore appropriate that I end my curent inings with what I consider one of my best rips. It has been a pleasure to be with you and I will miss you all. Its not a goodbye, just an au-revoir, for I will be back, although I don't know when. Perhaps it will be from the land of the red hills! Who knows!\n\nEncoded By ~ Debpk77","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc57daf5562d9b24ef988ba5de9779338d8af10","amp;dn":"You+Dont+Belong+-+DVDRip+-+x264+-+1CDRip+-+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc57daf5562d9b24ef988ba5de9779338d8af10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,197,125,175,85,98,217,178,78,249,136,186,93,233,119,147,56,216,175,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
