The celebration of violence sung in his works, re-elaborated in abstract form by the late followers of Bataille, has led to the creation of a peculiar talk emphasizing difference, antagonism, intellectual despair, and a profound political conservatism. As the so-called Left has lately come to adopt this troubling gospel of divisiveness, the consequence for a wholesome culture of dissent in our society have been a disastrous paralysis of its critical and moral faculties in the face of a new dawn of never-ending wars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:790dddf5b24b042a22a13315d31b45de5b4395f2","amp;dn":"+The+Ideology+of+Tyranny%3A+The+Use+of+Neo-Gnostic+Myth+in+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"790dddf5b24b042a22a13315d31b45de5b4395f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,13,221,245,178,75,4,42,34,161,51,21,211,27,69,222,91,67,149,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
