Also Pat Mills   \n\nlearned valuable lessons from Action which lead to the success of the ongoing \n\n2000AD weekly. \n\nQuote from wikipedia - Mills learned how to deal with the launch of a varied, edgy \n\ncomic when planning the launch of 2000 AD the following year. By setting the comic\n\nstories in a science fiction context, and creating the violent character of Judge \n\nDredd as a law-upholding policeman, Mills hoped to avoid the controversy that had \n\nultimately led to the demise of Action. Some strips with an Action feel were \n\nprinted in early issues of 2000 AD, including Flesh, which was a violent time  \n\n-travel story involving dinosaurs, and Shako, which was essentially Hook Jaw but \n\nwith a polar bear \n\ninstead of a shark.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c1b5178279fececb4e14900030e2fe3b180f53a","amp;dn":"Action+%26amp%3B+Battle+Action+%28UK%29+%28001+-+087+%26amp%3B+142+-+323+%2B+ext","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c1b5178279fececb4e14900030e2fe3b180f53a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,27,81,120,39,159,236,236,180,225,73,0,3,14,47,227,177,128,245,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
