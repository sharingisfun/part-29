This 20-track set collects some of the Jamaican originals that inspired the whole thing, and sides like Justin Hinds' &quot;Carry Go Bring Come,&quot; the Maytals' &quot;Monkey Man,&quot; Desmond Dekker's &quot;007 (Shanty Town),&quot; and the Ethiopians' &quot;Train to Skaville&quot; would be classic recordings in a discussion about any era or genre. It's possible to look at this release as an introduction to the so-called Two Tone Revolution in Britain, but it's also possible to just view it as a nice set of classic Jamaican singles. Either way, it's fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b08d7d1ce82d0589baf9d3595f8cf277544f77","amp;dn":"Ska+Madness%21+20+Reggae+Classics+Which+Inspired+the+Two+Tone+Revo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b08d7d1ce82d0589baf9d3595f8cf277544f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,176,141,125,28,232,45,5,137,186,249,211,89,95,140,242,119,84,79,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
