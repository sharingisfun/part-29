Mary is a young Irish orphan sent to live with her aunt and uncle in Cornwall. She gets herself in trouble by discovering that Uncle Joss is the leader of the Pirates...\n\nJamaica Inn was the last Hitchcock film shot in the UK before starting his Hollywood career.\n\nAmazing performance by Charles Laughton. This film maybe the only Hitchcock film where an actor is more dominant than Hitchcock himself.\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL SPECS\n\nFile Size: 700 MB (716,806 KB / 734,009,344 bytes)\nRuntime: 1:38:55 (148,365 frames)\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size: 512 x 384\nFPS: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate: 872 kb/s\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\nAudio bitrate: 104 kb/s\n\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish and Turkish (All Subtitles are 25FPS but some may need to resync)\n\n\n\nScreen Shots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=4020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=4020&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
