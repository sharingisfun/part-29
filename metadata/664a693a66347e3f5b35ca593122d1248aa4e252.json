When he insults the fort's commanding officer, the military execution squad is replaced by Negro orderlies. \n\nEnraged by this humiliation, the Rebels' ranking officer, Capt. Dorrit Bentley, effects a mass escape by blowing up the fort. While on the run, he and his men kill a detail of Union soldiers and take as hostage Emily Biddle, a missionary engaged to the fort's second-in-command, Maj. Charles Wolcott. Wolcott is ordered to lead a pursuit party, and Bentley's men make their way to a small town in the Arizona badlands, where they plan to ambush their pursuers. \n\nBentley allows one of his men to kill a Union dispatch rider in a saloon and learns from the victim's papers that Lee has surrendered at Appomattox. Although he conceals the news from his men, Bentley divulges the information to Emily, then rapes and beats her into unconsciousness before heading toward the Mexican border with his troops. \n\nWolcott and his men enter town, and Emily, just as Bentley intended, withholds the news about the war and demands that he track down and kill the captain. The two men finally clash in a deserted mission at the Arizona-Mexico border......................\n\nThe savage nature of the film was carried off in an edgy way, making it play out better than the preachy and much too talkative script. Ford can play this earnest soldier role in his sleep and gives the film the lift it craved to be somewhat better than a B film.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.27gb\nDuration.... 01:25:08\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width.... 1024\nFrame Height.... 576\nData Rate.... 2016kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:664a693a66347e3f5b35ca593122d1248aa4e252","amp;dn":"A+Time+For+Killing+1967+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"664a693a66347e3f5b35ca593122d1248aa4e252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,74,105,58,102,52,126,63,91,53,202,89,49,34,209,36,138,164,226,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
