The game is currently in alpha and contains a wide range of single player content including:\r\n\r\n    A creative mode allowing you to push your designs to the limit and ensure the total annihilation of your opponents.\r\n    A campaign waged over hundreds of islands against eight unique factions.\r\n    A Story Mode where you can (eventually!) play 15 missions as each of the eight factions - a fantastic mixture of strategy, design and wild battles! Defend your fleet against waves of enemy forces in a series of extremely tough challenges that unlock new components. \r\n\r\nAn expansive multiplayer and co-op element is planned for the coming months!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a88035dd0f11fed31be38053f446ea51a6904be","amp;dn":"From+the+Depths+v1.88","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a88035dd0f11fed31be38053f446ea51a6904be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,136,3,93,208,241,31,237,49,190,56,5,63,68,110,165,26,105,4,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
