Key to the model is the development of specific privacy rights: a right to roam the internet with privacy, a right to monitor the monitors, a right to delete personal data and a right to create, assert and protect an online identity. These rights could help in the formulation of more effective and appropriate legislation, and shape more privacy-friendly business models. The conclusion examines how the internet might look with these rights in place and whether such an internet could be sustainable from both a governmental and a business perspective","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b65805b93987daaf9200af1ec2474f6a32c2f7","amp;dn":"Internet+Privacy+Rights+%282014%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b65805b93987daaf9200af1ec2474f6a32c2f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,182,88,5,185,57,135,218,175,146,0,175,30,194,71,79,106,50,194,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
