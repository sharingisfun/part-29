The use of solar power is far less damaging to the environment than burning fossil fuels to generate power. In comparison to other renewable energy resources such as hydro power, wind, and geothermal, solar has unmatched portability and thus flexibility. The sun shines everywhere. These characteristics make solar power a key energy source as we move away from our fossil fuel dependency, and toward more sustainable and clean ways to meet our energy needs. The sun is a powerful energy resource. Although very little of the billions of megawatts per second generated by the sun reaches our tiny Earth, there is more than enough to be unlimited in potential for terrestrial power production. \n\nThe sunlight that powers solar cells travels through space at 186,282 miles per hour to reach the earth 8.4 minutes after leaving the surface of the sun. About 1,368W/M2 is released at the top of the earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s atmosphere. Although the solar energy that reaches the EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surface is reduced due to water vapor, ozone layer absorption and scattering by air molecules, there is still plenty of power for us to collect. Harvesting photons for use in homes, factories, offices, vehicles and personal electronics has become practical, and economical, and will continue to increase in its importance in the energy supply equation.\n\nIn my opinion, the most exciting aspect of photovoltaic power generation is that it creates opportunities for the individual power consumer to be involved in the production of power. Even if it is only in a small way, you can have some control of where your energy comes from. Almost anyone can set up a solar panel and use the power ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ independent of the grid and other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpowers that be.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Batteries and super capacitors for the electronic devices that we use on a daily basis can be recharged by this natural and renewable energy resource. Doing so cuts down on pollution and makes life better for everyone. Practically every aspect of our lives will be touched in a positive way by the increasing use of solar electric power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ed1371f486b5d9100caebec1bb78abf0abd92a","amp;dn":"Build+Your+Own+Solar+Panel+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ed1371f486b5d9100caebec1bb78abf0abd92a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,237,19,113,244,134,181,217,16,12,174,190,193,187,120,171,240,171,217,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
