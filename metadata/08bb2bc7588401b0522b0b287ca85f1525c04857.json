Gabriel advises that because he performs the exorcisms for\nhis own benefit, they are vain acts that will not spare him from Hell. After his\nmeeting with Gabriel, Constantine is attacked by a full-fledged demon. After a\nmeeting with a former witch doctor known as Papa Midnite (Djimon Honsou) fails to\nproduce answers, Constantine begins investigating the situation with his associates\nBeeman (Max Baker), Hennessy (Pruitt Taylor Vince), and Chas Kramer (Shia LaBeouf).\nL.A.P.D. Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) shows up at Constantine's condo\nseeking consultation regarding her investigation of the death of her twin sister\nIsabel, who leapt from the roof of a mental hospital. Constantine tells Angela that\nGod and Lucifer are engaged in a proxy war; a standing wager for the souls of all\nmankind. Neither true angels nor demons can manifest on Earth, but they are allowed\nto possess and influence humans.\n\n\nPrimary Cast\n\nKeanu Reeves as John Constantine\nShia LaBeouf as Chas Kramer\nRachel Weisz as Angela Dodson\nTilda Swinton as Gabriel\nDjimon Hounsou as Papa Midnite\nGavin Rossdale as Balthazar\n\nSupporting Cast\n\nPeter Stormare as Lucifer\n\nNotes\n\nThe character of John Constantine was created by British author, Alan Moore.
