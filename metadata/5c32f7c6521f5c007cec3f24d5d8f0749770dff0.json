Organized so that readers progressively learn and apply the theoretical knowledge described in the parent book, the manual covers a range of essential topics, including:\n\nMain quality control measurements used to determine physical, morphological, chemical-nutritional, and sensory properties of cereal grains and their products\n\nCritical factors affecting grain stability throughout storage and analytical techniques related to insects and pests responsible for grain storage losses\n\nPhysical and chemical tests to determine the quality of refined products\n\nLaboratory wet-milling procedures\n\nThe most common laboratory methods to assess nixtamal, masa, and tortilla quality and shelf-life\n\nYeast and chemical leavening agents important for bakery and other fermented products\n\nLaboratory and pilot plant procedures for the production of different types of yeast- and chemically-leavened bread, crackers, pasta products, breakfast cereals, and snack foods\n\nProtocols to bioenzymatically transform starch into modified starches, syrups, and sweeteners\n\nLaboratory processes for the production of regular and light beers, distilled spirits, and fuel ethanol\n\n\n\nBy working through the contents of the book, readers acquire hands-on experience in many quality control procedures and experimental product development protocols of cereal-based products. From these foundations, they are certain to develop enhanced research skills for product development, process design, and ingredient functionality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c32f7c6521f5c007cec3f24d5d8f0749770dff0","amp;dn":"Cereal+Grains%3A+Laboratory+Reference+and+Procedures+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c32f7c6521f5c007cec3f24d5d8f0749770dff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,50,247,198,82,31,92,0,124,236,63,36,213,216,240,116,151,112,223,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
