Born Thomas Lee Bass on October 3, 1962, in Athens, Greece, he grew up in Los Angeles, co-founding the band Christmas with bassist Nikki Sixx in 1981; with the subsequent additions of guitarist Mick Mars and singer Vince Neil, the group was renamed MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e and immediately became a top attraction on the local hard rock scene. Signing to Elektra in 1983, the CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e emerged as one of the best-selling and most notorious metal bands of the era, scoring a series of hit albums including 1985's Theatre of Pain, 1987's Girls, Girls, Girls, and 1989's Dr. Feelgood; famed for their glamorously excessive offstage antics as much as their music itself, Lee in particular became steady tabloid fodder in 1986 with his marriage to Dynasty vixen Heather Locklear, a tumultuous relationship which ended in divorce eight years later. \n\nEven as MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e's fortunes waned, Lee remained in the limelight thanks to his 1995 marriage to pin-up Pamela Anderson, a union which produced two children as well as an infamous homemade sex video which became a bestseller. Run-ins with the law were also common: in 1997, he and Sixx were arrested after encouraging fans to rush the stage during a concert stop in Phoenix, and a year later Lee was arraigned for assaulting a photographer. Most scandalously, in May 1998, he was sentenced to six months in jail for assaulting Anderson, although the two later reunited. He left MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e in 1999, collaborating with rapper TiLo on Methods of Mayhem, an all-star project featuring input from Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, the Crystal Method, Kid Rock, Snoop Dogg, and Mix Master Mike. Signing to MCA, Methods of Mayhem issued their self-titled debut LP in late 1999. The record went platinum, but the group disbanded in 2000, only to be resurrected in 2009. The groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sophomore effort, A Public Disservice Announcement, was released the following year on Loud &amp; Proud/Roadrunner Records. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60894c7829e1be7b319377dcba90a53de73cc1a7","amp;dn":"Methods+of+Mayhem+-+A+Public+Disservice+Announcement+%28Special+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60894c7829e1be7b319377dcba90a53de73cc1a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,137,76,120,41,225,190,123,49,147,119,220,186,144,165,61,231,60,193,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
