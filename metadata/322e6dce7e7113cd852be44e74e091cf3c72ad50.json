COUNTRY SIDE OF LIFE is a thoughtful compilation that highlights the band in its 1980's prime. Unabashedly commercial and loaded with Southern and rural imagery, the band's smooth country sound is best evidenced on such tracks as &quot;A Very Special Love,&quot; where strings add lush smoothness to a celebratory song about love's intangible beauty. Other songs such as &quot;Forty Hour Week (For a Livin')&quot; pay homage to blue collar workers everywhere. Complete with several live tracks, COUNTRY SIDE OF LIFE is an extensive survey of a band that changed the face of country music.\n\n\n1. My Home's In Alabama\n2. Green River\n3. You Turn Me On\n4.
