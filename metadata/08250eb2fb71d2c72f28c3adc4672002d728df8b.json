ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not to say that you shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell your spouse you love them, but let me suggest (for the man and the woman) some ways that you can say I love you without saying it.\n\nHusbands\n\nConnect Physically\n\nHold her hand\nGiver her a back/neck massage\nPlay with her hair\nMassage her feet\nOpen her door\nGive her a hug\nOffer your arm\nCuddle next to her while sitting down\nPut your arm around her neck\nOffer your shoulder for her head\nAround the House\n\nMake the bed, before she gets to it\nCook her a meal\nVacuum the house\nPlay her a songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a favorite of hers\nDo that project sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been asking you about\nDo a project that you know needs to be done without her asking\nChange the infantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s diaper\nGo to sleep with her at night\nLet her sleep in while you watch the kids\nBuy her some flowers for display\nIdeas\n\nLeave notes around the house telling her how much

often)\nWrite her a snail-mail letter and have it delivered to the house when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not there\nCall the grandparents to watch the kids for the night and surprise her by taking her out.\nTake the children out and let her have the day off\nLet her have a ladies night out\nWriter her a poem\nHelp your kids to write her a banner or note\nWives\n\nThe problem I have here is that I know that wives are so often showing their love that it would take something out of the ordinary to be different, and yet I will list some things (and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re probably dual purpose ).\n\nConnect Physically\n\nPrepare his meals\nRun his house\nHelp raise his kids\nGreet him at the door with a kiss\nHold his hand\nCuddle with him\nGive him a massage\nLay your head on his lap the
