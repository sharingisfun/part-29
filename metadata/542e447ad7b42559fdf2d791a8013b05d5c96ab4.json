No more shortcut. Just double click exe file.\n\n2. Game Credits/Lines buttons reflect actual machine.\n\n3. *** UPDATED *** New routine to center window (instead of top-left corner)\n\n4. Don't have to uncheck &quot;Belly Panel&quot; before playing anymore.\n\n5. Indian Dreaming has 2 exe's...with/without train jackpot.\n\n6. No virtual hand, except for atlantis because it needs it for feature.\n\n7. *** NEW *** Nicer Button Layout (less cluttered)\n\nAs always if you don't have sound you need to enable windows xp compatibility mode.\n\n***NOTE***\nwindows positions calculated for windows 8. other versions of windows probably will not line up properly due to changes in windows ui (window borders etc).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542e447ad7b42559fdf2d791a8013b05d5c96ab4","amp;dn":"aristocrat+slots+-+4+games+%2A%2A%2A+NEW+%2A%2A%2A+%2A%2A%2A+UPDATED+%2A%2A%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542e447ad7b42559fdf2d791a8013b05d5c96ab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,46,68,122,215,180,37,89,253,242,215,145,168,1,59,5,213,201,106,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
