The films gives viewers an unprecedented behind-the-scenes view of the strategies engineers and drivers use as they set out to make history against local favorite, Team Peugeot. &quot;Truth in 24&quot; rides alongside drivers Tom Kristensen, Allan McNish and Dindo Capello as they prepare for the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans contest. Unlike any sports production, the film brings out all the drama and emotion of the 76-year old race and the people trying to win it. \n\nThis is my first upload this is itunes or ipod ready, it should also be compatible with the ps3 also!
