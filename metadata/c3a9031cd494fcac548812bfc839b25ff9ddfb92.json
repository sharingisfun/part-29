(ENGLISH)(WINDOWS)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tTomb Raider:Chronicles\n\n\n\nTombRaider 5 Chronicles Overview:\n\nAfter being buried alive in the Temple of Horus at the end of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, our heroine is presumed dead. Friends and colleagues gather at the Croft mansion to pay their respects and reminisce over Lara&amp;#039;s past deeds. In flashback sequences the player gets to relive four of these adventures: The hunt for the Philosopher&amp;#039;s Stone in Rome, a deepsea dive off the coast of Russia in search of the Spear of Destiny, a brush with Hellspawn in old Ireland, and a foray into a high-tech office complex to retrieve the Iris artifact. Lara&amp;#039;s fate is still unknown, but these four mini-stories helped fill the gap between The Last Revelation and TR6, The Angel of Darkness.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a9031cd494fcac548812bfc839b25ff9ddfb92","amp;dn":"TombRaider+5+Chronicles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a9031cd494fcac548812bfc839b25ff9ddfb92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,169,3,28,212,148,252,172,84,136,18,191,200,57,178,95,249,221,251,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
