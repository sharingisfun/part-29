Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden, the dub savants behind contemporary club successes that include Andain's &amp;quot;Beautiful Things&amp;quot;, Motorcycle's &amp;quot;As the Rush Comes&amp;quot; and Sarah McLachlan's &amp;quot;Fallen,&amp;quot; conjur up a nigh-seamless soundscape of haunting textures and percolating beats here, forcefully pushing the envelope of what a smart song-score can be in the bargain. Their rhythmic reinvention of The Engine Room's theme for the show, &amp;quot;A Perfect Lie,&amp;quot; sets the cynical, haunting tone, with Gabriel and Dresden employing a sensibility that's both more mature and austere than their typical club work. G&amp;amp;D infuse that consistently entrancing sensibility to material as diverse as the cool-jazz of &amp;quot;Angels&amp;quot; by Wax Poetic/Norah Jones, Daniel Ash's stripped-down reinvention of the standard &amp;quot;Fever&amp;quot; and the retro-disco of Client's &amp;quot;Price of Love.&amp;quot; If it's a triumph of style over substance, it's one that musically underscores the show's similar themes with grace and ever-detached elegance. --Jerry McCulley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9250fd585d4bd9c482e4bcf2e2515d5709d2f36f","amp;dn":"Nip%2FTuck+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9250fd585d4bd9c482e4bcf2e2515d5709d2f36f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,80,253,88,93,75,217,196,130,228,188,242,226,81,93,87,9,210,243,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
