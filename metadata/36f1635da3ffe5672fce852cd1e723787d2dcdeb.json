It questions the members of the ICF about their motives and attitudes. It gives the views of Leicester University sociologists who have for five years studied the social roots of football spectator violence. It offers evidence to judge the degree to which the politicians, the sociologists, the Popplewell report and public opinion have got it right.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36f1635da3ffe5672fce852cd1e723787d2dcdeb","amp;dn":"Hooligan+-+Documentary+about+the+Inter+City+Firm+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36f1635da3ffe5672fce852cd1e723787d2dcdeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,241,99,93,163,255,229,103,47,206,133,44,209,231,35,120,125,45,205,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
