It is a discovery that could completely rewrite our understanding of our solar system and how it formed.\r\n\r\nAs the world's biggest telescopes start scanning the skies searching for Planet 9, the Sky at Night team investigates. If Planet 9 exists, where is it and where did it come from?\r\n\r\nIn California, Chris Lintott meets the astronomers whose study of the distant Kuiper Belt led them to predict the existence of the planet. And while some scientists are still sceptical, Maggie Aderin-Pocock discovers how our models of the formation of the solar system and the discovery of similar exoplanets around other stars all support the existence of Planet 9.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 499 MiB\r\nDuration : 29mn 7s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 396 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04920011c5a1573983ce1591b9e360ab350b1f29","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Sky+at+Night+Planet+9+from+Ou+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04920011c5a1573983ce1591b9e360ab350b1f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,146,0,17,197,161,87,57,131,206,21,145,185,227,96,171,53,11,31,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
