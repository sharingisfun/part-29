But is this the real Cleopatra or one invented by male historians anxious to discredit an intelligent, competent woman who was the last great pharaoh of Egypt?\n\nIn Cleopatra, the true story reveals her to be a woman who used her great intelligence, imagination, personality, and indomitable drive in a tragic attempt to restore Egypt to the greatness it had known under the great pharaohs of old. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d1b16648183f95eefb52648344503f07d02ccf","amp;dn":"Cleopatra+%28Ancient+World+Leaders+series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d1b16648183f95eefb52648344503f07d02ccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,209,177,102,72,24,63,149,238,251,82,100,131,68,80,63,7,208,44,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
