In production with illustrator Russ Brown.\n\nIf Sam Peckinpah directed Night of the Living Dead, if a particularly bloody Old Testament story was ghost written by Kathryn Bigelow and John Carpenter, if GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite film was The Outlaw Josey WalesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be something in the comic world like The Killing Jar. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not. Yet.\n\nA small Colorado town. Three drug runners with a van filled with product. Two police officers investigating suspicious ACTIVITY. A heroic young woman with a violent past, a mentally handicapped little brother and her dead fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s .38 police special. And a throng of ravenous townspeople out of their minds with drug lust. Mix andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦BANG!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Take the religious fervor of PREACHER, mix it up with the action chops of LA FEMME NIKITA and sprinkle in a little bit of DAWN OF THE DEAD and you have THE KILLING JAR, the most fun you can have legally. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to see where the twisted road takes this one.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72b71435f97fde270256da347d4d7639f2bd75e0","amp;dn":"The+Killing+Jar+v1+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28d%27argh-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72b71435f97fde270256da347d4d7639f2bd75e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,183,20,53,249,127,222,39,2,86,218,52,125,77,118,57,242,189,117,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
