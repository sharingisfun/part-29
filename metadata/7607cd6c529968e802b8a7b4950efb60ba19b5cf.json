Take all thoughts of watching bands sweat through the ordeal of playing live, with cliched &amp;#039;backstage&amp;#039; glimpses out of your mind - together Mark Borthwick and Cat Power have brought fragility and beauty to the medium.\nFilmed all in one scene, the DVD shows Cat Power playing a wonderfully lush forest in Mexico, with crickets, tractors and birds as her only audience.\nAs she plays though songs from the last album and some cover versions, the viewer is transplanted to this tranquil, natural scene.\nLoopy and unusual? Maybe. An open, vulnerable and an amazing piece of art? Most definitely.\nCreated, packaged and directed by experimental filmmaker and visual artist Mark Borthwick.\n\n\nTracklisting (not necessarily in order):\n\nTime Is On My Side / Night Time, Back Of Your Head / Rule The Islands / You / Knockin&amp;#039; On Heaven&amp;#039;s Door / From Fur City / I Want / Dream, Blue Moon, Try A Little Tenderness / Farewell My Enemy / Sad, Sad Song / Evolution / Sophisticated Lady / I Don&amp;#039;t Blame You / The Party / Funny Things / Love &amp; Communication / Lord, Help","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7607cd6c529968e802b8a7b4950efb60ba19b5cf","amp;dn":"Cat+Power+-+Speaking+For+Trees+%28A+Film+By+Mark+Borthwick%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7607cd6c529968e802b8a7b4950efb60ba19b5cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,7,205,108,82,153,104,232,2,184,167,180,149,14,251,96,186,25,181,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
