The topics covered range from the description of test bodies, to self-gravitating (heavy) bodies, to current and future observations.\r\n\r\nEmphasis is put on the coverage of various approximation methods (e.g., multipolar, post-Newtonian, self-force methods) which are extensively used in the context of the relativistic problem of motion. Applications discussed in this volume range from the motion of binary systems -- and the gravitational waves emitted by such systems -- to observations of the galactic center. In particular the impact of choices at a fundamental theoretical level on the interpretation of experiments is highlighted.\r\n\r\nThis book provides a broad and up-do-date status report, which will not only be of value for the experts working in this field, but also may serve as a guideline for students with background in General Relativity who like to enter this field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0384cf652f31458c9b7fdee21e244139eebc40d3","amp;dn":"Equations+of+Motion+in+Relativistic+Gravity+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0384cf652f31458c9b7fdee21e244139eebc40d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,132,207,101,47,49,69,140,155,127,222,226,30,36,65,57,238,188,64,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
