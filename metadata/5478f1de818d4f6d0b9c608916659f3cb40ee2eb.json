In Physics Demystified best-selling author Stan Gibilisco offers a fun, effective, and totally painless way to learn the fundamentals and general concepts of physics.\n\nWith Physics Demystified you master the subject one simple step at a time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at your own speed. Unlike most books on physics, general principles are presented first ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the details follow. In order to make the learning process as clear and simple as possible, heavy-duty math, formulas, and equations are kept to a minimum. This unique self-teaching guide offers questions at the end of each chapter and section to pinpoint weaknesses, and a 100-question final exam to reinforce the entire book.\n\nSimple enough for a beginner but challenging enough for an advanced student, Physics Demystified is your direct route to learning or brushing up on physics.\n\nHEREÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO:\n* Understand the math used in physical science\n* Solve mass/force/acceleration problems\n* Create mathematical models of physical phenomena\n* Perform distance vs. time calculations\n* Determine potential and kinetic energy\n* Calculate the wavelength of sounds and radio signals\n* Understand visible light interference patterns\n* Calculate the energy and frequency of a moving particle\n* Understand atomic structure\n* Learn about electric current, voltage, resistance, power, and energy\nFrom the Back Cover\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO UNDERSTAND PHYSICS\n\nNow anyone with an interest in the physical sciences can master physics -- without formal training or drowning in a sea of complicated formulas and equations.
