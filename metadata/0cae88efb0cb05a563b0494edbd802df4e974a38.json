You really would need very expensive speakers to hear the difference from FLAC.  Fuck the MP3; it's outdated and should never be used again.\n\n\nAbout the album:\n\nA collection of all three volumes of the band's Greatest Hits, spanning a career that produced masterpieces such as 'Bohemian Rhapsody', 'Radio Ga Ga' and 'Barcelona'.  51 songs in total. \n\nQueen\nGreatest Hits\nThe Platinum collection (2002)\n3 CDs\n\nSource:  FLAC from TPB\nEncoding: MPEG-4 HE AAC v2\n\nEncoder Settings:  \nExtension: m4a\nQuality: Maximum\nBit rate: 48\nVBR:  On\nEncoder: Max 0.9.1\n\nAbout HE AAC v2:\n\nHigh Efficiency AAC v2 Profile Ã¢â‚¬â€œ defined in 2006, uses AAC-LC, SBR, PS\n\nAdvanced Audio Coding is designed to be the successor of the MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, known as MP3 format.  \n\nHE-AAC v2, a.k.a. aacPlus v2 or eAAC+, the combination of Parametric Stereo (PS) and HE-AAC; used for even lower bitrates; defined in 2004 and 2006\n\nAAC and HE-AAC are better than MP3 at low bit rates (typically less than 128 kilobits per second). This is especially true at very low bit rates where the superior stereo coding, pure MDCT, and better transform window sizes leave MP3 unable to compete.\n\nWhile the MP3 format has near-universal hardware and software support, primarily due to MP3 being the format of choice during the crucial first few years of widespread music file-sharing/distribution over the internet, AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support\n\nTracks\nDisc 1\n101.bohemian rhapsody \n102.another one bites the dust \n103.killer queen \n104.fat bottomed girls \n105.bicycle race \n106.you're my best friend \n107.don't stop me now \n108.save me \n109.crazy little thing called love \n110.somebody to love \n111.now i'm here \n112.good old fashioned lover boy \n113.play the game \n114.flash \n115.seven seas of rhye \n116.we will rock you \n117.we are the champions \n\nDisc 2\n201.a kind of magic \n202.under pressure \n203.radio ga ga \n204.i want it all \n205.i want to break free \n206.innuendo \n207.it's a hard life \n208.breakthrough \n209.who wants to live forever \n210.headlong \n211.the miracle \n212.i'm going slightly mad \n213.the invisible man \n214.hammer to fall \n215.friends will be friends \n216.the show must go on \n217.one vision \n\nDisc 3\n310.the show must go on-queen &amp; elton john \n302.under pressure-queen &amp; david bowie \n303.barcelona-freddie mercury &amp; montserrat caballe \n304.too much love will kill you \n305.somebody to love-george michael &amp; queen \n306.you don't fool me \n307.heaven for everyone \n308.las palabras de amor \n309.driven by you-brian may \n310.living on my own-freddie mercury \n311.let me live \n312.the great pretender-freddie mercury \n313.princes of the universe \n314.another one bites the dust-queen &amp; wyclef jean \n315.no one but you \n316.these are the days of our lives \n317.thank god it's christmas ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cae88efb0cb05a563b0494edbd802df4e974a38","amp;dn":"Queen+Platinum+Collection+%5BHE+AAC+v2+VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cae88efb0cb05a563b0494edbd802df4e974a38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,174,136,239,176,203,5,165,99,176,73,78,219,216,2,223,78,151,74,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
