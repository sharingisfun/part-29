Of course the engineering and production were handled by Konrad Plank. &quot;Goodbye Future&quot; is indeed a very varied album and contains a certain strange ZAPPA-esque wierdness throughout. This album contains some simply mind numbing space explorations carrying a certain improvised Canterbury-influenced jazz-rock feel throughout. I would certainly consider this to be classic Krautrock for sure as it carries that underground German prog sound that we have all love. An excellent album full of grand percussion, keyboard and bass interplay.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5daaf7c82816ee23e3cd2d395b51d7d80fe1f980","amp;dn":"Tomorrow%27s+Gift+-+Goodbye+Future+%281973%2F2006%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5daaf7c82816ee23e3cd2d395b51d7d80fe1f980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,170,247,200,40,22,238,35,227,205,45,57,91,81,215,216,15,225,249,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
