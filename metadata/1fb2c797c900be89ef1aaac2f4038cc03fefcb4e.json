This here offering is called RVG because Van Gelder\n\nmerely remastered it in 2001, not that I'm belittling his great contribution to\n\njazz otherwise.  These are old mono recordings from 1954 and 24 bit remastering\n\nat this point is overkill IMO.  Some of these were recorded on my birthday.\n\nIt would take me 25 years to really dig into jazz music, especially that from\n\nthe late '50s.  Great harmony here and I just can't hear enough ZOOT!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fb2c797c900be89ef1aaac2f4038cc03fefcb4e","amp;dn":"CLIFFORD+BROWN+%2F+Jazz+Immortal+%2F+BlueNote%2FPacific%2FRVG+%2F+1954","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fb2c797c900be89ef1aaac2f4038cc03fefcb4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,178,199,151,201,0,190,137,239,26,170,194,244,3,140,192,63,239,203,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
