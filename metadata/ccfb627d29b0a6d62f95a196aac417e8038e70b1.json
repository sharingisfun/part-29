This involves going without food, liquids and even medication between the hours of dawn until sunset, putting people with diabetes at significant risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose), or dehydration. This book is a guide to the management of patients with diabetes during Ramadan. Beginning with an introduction to the physiology and endocrinology of fasting, the following chapters examine both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options. The final sections are dedicated to management of the condition in different population groups (children, adolescents, the elderly); and management of complications, including hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic emergencies, and co-morbid conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease.
