But to fit their fragmentary perspectives into a coherent whole, we urgently need generalists. A world-renowned specialist (anthropology), Ashley Montagu, by transforming himself into the foremost integrator and interpreter of all sciences, also has become the most significant generalist of the last millenium.\n\nThe same man who worked out the embryology of the upper jaw (now employed by surgeons everywhere to repair cleft palate) has also in his 50 published books contributed epochally to practically every major social movement of the last 70 years.\n\nConsider his THE ELEPHANT MAN (1971, 1979, 1996), the basis of the play and film of the same name, which has kindled the current global drives to emancipate the disabled. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080678/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080678/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOr THE NATURAL SUPERIORITY OF WOMEN (1953, 1968, 1973, 1991), which sparked the women's liberation movements.\n\nOr his first book MAN'S MOST DANGEROUS MYTH: The Fallacy of Race (1942, 6th ed. 1998), which across the last 56 years has demolished for the majority of his colleagues everywhere the scientific credibility of the very concept of race, as well as launched the burgeoning worldwide movements for ethnic liberation.\n\nIncidentally, Dr. Montagu to date has brought out single-handedly all the updated editions of his books  and now, at 93, is actively at work on others.
