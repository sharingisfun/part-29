Denitch, professor of political sociology, is one of the few Eastern European and Soviet experts to have predicted the revolutions within Eastern Europe in 1989. Against the backdrop of unprecedented change in the world political and social order, he charts the unique opportunities and potential pitfalls that accompany the increased economic and political integration of the European Community. Historically, any move toward unification has had broad ramifications. This, coming as it does in the wake of recent democratic upheavals in Europe, will bring to a close an entire era - an era of a world dominated by superpowers and the cold war that defined their confrontations. Aside from its comprehensiveness, the book's greatest strength is that Denitch's socialist reading of recent events provides a perspective quite different from that found in most commentaries. It is interesting that while most other socialists or leftists pretend to be heading in &quot;the other direction&quot;, Denitch makes no doubt that the future Europe will be socialistic in every way possible. The End of the Cold War is a cogent and realistic analysis of the prospects for a 'new Europe,' from a roughly social democratic point of view and shows an intimate acquaintance with the political trends and social developments of contemporary Europe. Find out how the 'new Europe' was planned to be the new EUSSR from the very start and that the &quot;downfall&quot; of Soviet Union didn't change nothing for the destiny of Europe. 125 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4dc7f4932be6f5f621f1604cea44741f5b9e6f1","amp;dn":"Denitch-End+of+Cold+War%28EU%2Csocialism%2Cglobal+power%29%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4dc7f4932be6f5f621f1604cea44741f5b9e6f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,220,127,73,50,190,111,95,98,31,22,4,206,164,71,65,245,185,230,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
