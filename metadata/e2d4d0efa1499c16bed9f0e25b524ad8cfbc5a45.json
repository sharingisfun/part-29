After a few years of saturating the club scene in Canada, the band finally landed a contract with Capitol Records in 1969. Producer, Jack Richardson, was drafted to produce a single which saw the band charting in their native country. Lineup changes ensued over the next year, until &quot;You&amp;#039;re My People&quot; hit store shelves in 1971.\n\nThe album was a solid mix of folk, pop, prog and organ driven hard rock. With stellar harmonies and a real wealth of musical diversity, the album seemed poised for success, but for one reason or another that never came to pass. More lineup changes took place over the next two years with Capitol issuing numerous failed singles. By 1973, the band was belly up and members went on to such bands as Rhinegold, Molly Oliver, Hanover Fist, Wrabit, Lee Aaron, Chilliwack and Headpins. Many of them are still active in both performing and producing music.\n\nDig this relic of a bygone era that still commands the interest of collectors and aficionados worldwide.
