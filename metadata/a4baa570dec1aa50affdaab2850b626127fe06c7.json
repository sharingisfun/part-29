W. Norton &amp; Company | 2013 | ISBN: 0393345475 | English | 521 pages | PDF | 25.4 MB\n\n\n Seth G. Jones presents a dramatic narrative of the on- the-ground police work; the elaborate investigations led by the CIA, FBI and MI5; and the shifting alliances between terrorist groups that have characterized the conflict against al Qa'ida. With gripping detail he recounts the hunt for the Times Square bomber and reveals startling information about Osama bin Laden during his final days. Drawing on recently declassified documents and court materials, transcripts of wiretapped conversations, and interviews, Jones navigates the &quot;waves&quot; (al Qa'ida attacks) and &quot;reverse waves&quot; (successful efforts to disrupt al Qa'ida), explaining how we might analyze past patterns in order to counter al Qa'ida and its allies. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4baa570dec1aa50affdaab2850b626127fe06c7","amp;dn":"Hunting+in+the+Shadows+-+The+Pursuit+of+Al+Qa%27ida+Since+9-11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4baa570dec1aa50affdaab2850b626127fe06c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,186,165,112,222,193,170,80,175,253,170,178,133,11,98,97,39,254,6,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
