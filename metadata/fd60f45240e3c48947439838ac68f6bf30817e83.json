Now he revisits America and the people who have\nmost fascinated hin to try to discover what motivates them, why they believe,\nand to find out what has happend to them since he last saw them.\nAlong the way, Louis thinks about what drives him to spend so much time among the \nweird people and considers whether he's learned anything about himself in the \ncourse of ten years working with them.\nHas he manipulated the people he's interviewed, or have they manipulated him?.\n\nFrom his Las Vergas base, Louis revisits the assorted dreamers and outlaws\nwho have been his TV feeding ground. Attempting to understand a little about hinself and the workings of his own mind, Louis considers questions such as:what is the difference\nbetween pathology and &quot;normal&quot; weirdness?. Is there something particuarly\nweird about Americans? What does it mean to be weird? or &quot;to be yourself&quot;.\nAnd do we choose our beliefs or do our beliefs choose us.\n\nRipped From 3 CD'S @ 64kbps MP3\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis and more available as direct downloads at the blog: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobooks-download.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobooks-download.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy!! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd60f45240e3c48947439838ac68f6bf30817e83","amp;dn":"Call+Of+The+Weird+Travels+in+American+Subcultures+-+Louis+Therou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd60f45240e3c48947439838ac68f6bf30817e83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,96,244,82,64,227,196,137,71,67,152,56,172,104,246,191,48,129,126,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
