Selected music from the Motion Picture sound tracks. 25 different enemy types, spectacular boss battle and vehicle sections. 15 different guns plus a range of different arrow-tips for Rambo's bow. No health-packs or recharging health-bar - Kill to heal with Wrath Mode. Unlock John Rambo's full warrior (and score-attack) potential with skill &amp; perks system.
