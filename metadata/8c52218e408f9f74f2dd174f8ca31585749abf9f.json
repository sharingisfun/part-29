Here's a collection of the digital releases of this week's All-New Marvel NOW! titles. \nIncluded are:\n\nAll-New X-Factor 004\nAll-New X-Men 024\nAvengers Undercover 001\nBlack Widow 004\nCaptain Marvel 001\nDeadpool 025.NOW\nFantastic Four 002\nHawkeye 017\nMighty Avengers 008\nSecret Avengers 001\nSuperior Spider-Man 029\nWolverine 003\nX-Force 002\nX-Men Legacy 300\nand\nREVOLUTIONARY WAR: MOTORMOUTH 001\nPart 6 of &quot;Revolutionary War&quot;\n* When Mys-Tech returns and threatens the safety of Great Britain, MI:13 need to try to convince MOTORMOUTH to come out of retirement.\n* Harley DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ days of being a hero are over, though.  Now, her day job is being the mother of  her two children. Until an explosive Mys-Tech attack calls her out of retirement!\n* Be there as Motormouth gets her mojo back!\n\n\nIf you like them and have the money, BUY THEM and support your favorite creators, writers, artists, local comic shops and publishers.\n\nSeriously, buy the comics you have money for. But only the ones you think deserve your money-- vote with your dollars, and also make your voices heard. Marvel has a pretty good internet presence, which also means they read emails, tweets, tumblr responses, facebook comments. They've shown that they are solely focused on sales numbers-- vote with yr money, and tell them with words (not curses). They WILL listen, eventually. You know-- the internets.\n\nAll my thanks to all the uploaders and scanners and seeders out there! Enjoy! (and seed!)\n\nPersonal commentary of the week: I sure am gonna miss The Superior Spider-Man. SpOck has grown on me, even if he's far from perfect and certainly no Peter. Also-- are you guys enjoying Black Widow's solo series? I'm definitely enjoying Black Widow's solo series. I feel like this is a sure indication she's going to be getting her own movie, or at least a Black Widow/Hawkeye movie, sooner rather than later. And Avengers Undercover looks like it has potential-- this is, after all, the sequel to the batshit insane Avengers Academy. Revolutionary War is still highly enjoyable, and a great callback to classic Marvel UK.\n\nFimbulwinter is Norse mythology is the endless winter that precedes Ragnarok. It sure feels like Fimbulwinter here in NYC! Thanks for giving me some good stuff to read while I'm freezing my butt off, fellow /602 peoples!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c52218e408f9f74f2dd174f8ca31585749abf9f","amp;dn":"Marvel+NOW%21+Week+69+All-New+Week+12+03%2F12%2F2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c52218e408f9f74f2dd174f8ca31585749abf9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,82,33,142,64,143,159,116,242,221,23,79,140,163,21,133,116,154,191,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
