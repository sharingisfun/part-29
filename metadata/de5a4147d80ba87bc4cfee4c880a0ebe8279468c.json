Roosevelt Sykes is the best represented artist here, and his leering vocals are hard to resist: After hearing the ribald metaphor of 'Dresser Drawers,' you'll never view furniture quite the same way again. His 'Kickin' Motor Scooter' is truly a marvel of smiling euphemism, with the song devoted to boasts of how he's 'A dangerous motor scooter...A tricky motor scooter!' Other artists, while not always as inventive lyrically, show a wide range of piano styles, from the bouncing syncopated jazz of 'Stendahl Stomp' to the trickling upper registers and restrained bass coaxed by Curtis Jones from a battered old piano in 'Tin Pan Alley Blues #2.' Not every track is unaccompanied piano, though. 'Every Time I Get to Drinking,' a blues dirge to the bottle, revolves around the elastic pull of an upright bass. The closing instrumental, Otis Spann's 'Three-in-One Blues,' features ominous bass chords wracked by a scattershot backing of drums. Despite being essentially a glorified soundcheck, and by far the least structured piece on the album, it's also the most primally satisfying. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de5a4147d80ba87bc4cfee4c880a0ebe8279468c","amp;dn":"%28Blues+VA%29+-+Blues+Piano+Orgy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de5a4147d80ba87bc4cfee4c880a0ebe8279468c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,90,65,71,216,11,168,123,196,207,238,76,136,10,14,190,130,121,70,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
