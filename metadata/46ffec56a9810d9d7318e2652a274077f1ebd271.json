Stewart, now disbanded but known to reunite from time to time. Stewart\nand Lennox were both previously in the bands The Catch and The Tourists. Their\nmusical style ranged from new wave and synthpop to pop rock and soft rock.\nEurythmics originally came together in 1980 and disbanded in 1990. They\nreunited in 1999 and split again in 2005. The duo released their first album,\nIn the Garden, in 1981 to little fanfare, but went on to achieve global success\nwith their second album Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), released in 1983.
