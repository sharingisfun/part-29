But oh well, such is the nature of these compilations.\n\nThis was the first issue of these tracks in this order. In 1997, the FAB CD was reissued on Hawg Leg 130 with no changes, simply as &quot;B&quot; Sides.\n\nAll the tracks ran at the wrong speed - some fast, some slow (quite slow!). It looks like the tracks are not straight from vinyl, but from cassette recordings of vinyl, (except the outtakes, which are probably extracted from other CDs of tape sources) because they were all horribly out of phase. This suggests tape recordings, as they don't make records that way. On most of the tracks, the right channel was overdriven into clipping. That's fixed now. I think I got all the clicks off all the records... it's a very nice listen now.\n\n1 Simple As That 4:16\n2 Tough On A Tighrope (extended mix) 6:55\n3 Yvonne's The One 4:19\n4 Pretty Little Head (extended mix) 6:55\n5 The First Stone 4:02\n6 Good Sign (Groove Mix) 7:24\n7 Waterspout 4:47\n8 Rainclouds 3:08\n9 I'll Give You A Ring 3:04\n10 Ode To A Koala Bear 3:40\n11 On The Wings Of A Nightingale (demo) 2:30\n12 Spies Like Us 4:43\n13 No More Lonely Nights (Mole Mix) 8:40\n14 1882 (live at The Hague 1972) 6:34\n\nffp file and artwork are included.\n\nPlease preserve the lossless quality of this material.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRemasters Workshop\nRMW 701","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4647c8fddd03a9c1721e039dc9dfc58e1443ba5","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+-+B-Sides+Himself+%28Remastered+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4647c8fddd03a9c1721e039dc9dfc58e1443ba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,100,124,143,221,208,58,156,23,33,224,57,220,157,252,88,225,68,59,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
