When Damien can't give a straight answer as to what was going on, Ama decides to go to Caoimhe to find out and has Damien struggling to cover his tracks. The power games continue as Tommy and Luke refuse to back down. With Judith caught in the middle, Luke is reluctant to hurt her even more but Yvonne insists escalation is the only option. Zumo and Decco might be at each other's throats but Paddy has his family back under one roof and he decides it's time Charlotte became a Bishop rather than a Lynch. \nAfter Cass' recent forays into baking, Jo suggests they have a charity bake-off. In order to keep the peace, Cass graciously bows out but Jo is surprised when Carol decides to enter. Leo is shocked when he hears Shannon wants to stay with her mother and is determined to give her something to come home to. He's soon under pressure again though when his tenants demand refurbishments in the office so Leo turns to Zumo to make a quick buck. \n\n[141Mb, 24mins, 670Kbps, 704x400, x264, mp4; Audio: AAC-LC, 128Kbps]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2294d8199b93c950599c189452ca49e9e34343dc","amp;dn":"Fair.City.S24E145.2013.09.12.pdtv.x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2294d8199b93c950599c189452ca49e9e34343dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,148,216,25,155,147,201,80,89,156,24,148,82,202,73,233,227,67,67,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
