Be sure to visit my site. We have tutorials and tech help for those of you either with a modded PS3, or those of you capable of having a modded PS3. You'll need a PS3 with firmware 3.55 or lower on it, or it can't be modded. I'll post the link as a response below.\n\nThis is confirmed working on my PS3, running PS3ita 1.1 firmware, Multiman 2.00.4, and a disc in the drive, with the backup on the internal HDD.\n\nHave fun guys, and the fixed Eboot comes with directions.
