A Purkiss, Consultant, previously lectured Structural Engineering at Aston University. His main areas of research were the behaviour of concrete, concrete composite materials and concrete structures at elevated temperatures, the experimental determination of the effects of spalling and its modelling using coupled heat and mass transfer, the determination of the characteristics of fire damaged concrete structures.\n\n* Design methods based on the fire sections of the new Structural Eurocodes\n* Worked calculations and examples clearly illustrate the effect of temperature rise and structural performance of structural elements\n* Essential reading for Structural Engineers, Building Designers, Architects, Fire Engineers and Building Control Officers\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 424 pages\n    * Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann; 2 edition (December 21, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0750664436\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0750664431","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e2fa4e233754cdfdb89c513943b8227029d7647","amp;dn":"Fire+Safety+Engineering+-+Design+of+Structures+2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e2fa4e233754cdfdb89c513943b8227029d7647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,47,164,226,51,117,76,223,219,137,197,19,148,59,130,39,2,157,118,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
