Truly a magnum opus, it is available either as a CD-ROM or as eight separate volumes, all of which have been created in the past 4 years. This herculean undertaking was directed by editor-in-chief Holger Pettersson with the aid of an assistant editor and associate editors of world renown in radiology, including representatives from both North America and western Europe.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe encyclopedia is not only massive in heft but also broad in scope. The 20,000 entries are arranged alphabetically within each volume, each entry consisting of at least one paragraph often accompanied by high-quality images. The images displayed encompass the full panoply of diagnostic imaging, ranging from conventional radiographs to MR images. The first seven volumes are devoted to physics techniques and procedures, normal anatomy, musculoskeletal and soft-tissue imaging (including breast imaging), gastrointestinal and urogenital imaging, chest and cardiovascular imaging, neuroradiology, and pediatric radiology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f1517ee908667c0c28516777d65f926dc36c87","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopaedia+of+Medical+Imaging++CD++%28ISO%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3f1517ee908667c0c28516777d65f926dc36c87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,241,81,126,233,8,102,124,12,40,81,103,119,214,95,146,109,195,108,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
