It was originally written by John Byrne and then later by Mike Carlin, and drawn first by Ron Wilson and later by Paul Neary. It was notable for elaborating on Ben Grimm&amp;#039;s poor childhood on Yancy Street in its first issue, as well as chronicling the Thing&amp;#039;s adventures as a professional wrestler.\n\nIt also crossed over heavily with Marvel&amp;#039;s Secret Wars event, after which the Thing elects to remain on the Beyonder&amp;#039;s Battleworld when he discovers that the planet enables him to return to human form at will. A full third of the series&amp;#039; stories (issues 10 through 22) take place on Battleworld.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9586f2f58e95fdfb584b73fd98387ea6edd7e7a2","amp;dn":"The+Thing+v1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9586f2f58e95fdfb584b73fd98387ea6edd7e7a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,134,242,245,142,149,253,251,88,75,115,253,152,56,126,166,237,215,231,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
