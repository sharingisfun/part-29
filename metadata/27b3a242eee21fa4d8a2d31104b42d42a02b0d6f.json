It built on ideas explored in the \nband's earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental \nexcursions that characterised their work following the departure in 1968 of \nfounder member, principal composer, and lyricist, Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of \nthe Moon's themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental \nillness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.\n\nDeveloped during live performances, an early version of the suite was premiered \nseveral months before studio recording began; new material was recorded in two \nsessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The group used some \nof the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including multitrack \nrecording and tape loops. Analogue synthesizers were given prominence in several\ntracks, and a series of recorded interviews with the band's road crew and others\nprovided the philosophical quotations used throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was\ndirectly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album as \nwell as the recruitment of non-lexical performer Clare Torry. The album's iconic\nsleeve, designed by Storm Thorgerson, features a prism that represents the \nband's stage lighting, the record's lyrical themes, and keyboardist \nRichard Wright's request for a &quot;simple and bold&quot; design.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success, topping the Billboard Top \nLPs &amp; Tapes chart for one week. It subsequently remained in the charts for 741 \nweeks from 1973 to 1988. With an estimated 50 million copies sold, it is Pink \nFloyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums \nworldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered \nin its entirety by several other acts. It spawned two singles, &quot;Money&quot; and \n&quot;Time&quot;. In addition to its commercial success, The Dark Side of the Moon is one \nof Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently \nranked as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSide A:\n01.
