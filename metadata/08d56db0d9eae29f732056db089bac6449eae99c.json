Then he is afforded a nightmare vision of his loved onesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ future after his death. The spirits or goblins in his local church bells show him how anyone, however good, may descend into degradation and ruin if sufficiently driven by circumstances. The chimes teach Trotty that nobody is born wicked, that crime and vice are man-made conditions, and that poor people have the same right to seek improvement and happiness as the rich.\n\nFor more Inofrmations visit: http://opencast.de/?p=260\n\nwww.opencast.de your yource of free Public Domain ebooks and Audiobooks ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d56db0d9eae29f732056db089bac6449eae99c","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+THE+CHIMES%2C+by+Charles+Dickens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d56db0d9eae29f732056db089bac6449eae99c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,213,109,176,217,234,226,159,115,32,86,219,8,155,172,100,73,234,233,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
