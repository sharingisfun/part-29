Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and Michael Golden and unrelated backup features by others; this series was canceled after nine issues. Articles in these issues claimed that Howard was Mayerik's idea, though this is contrary to statements by both Gerber and Mayerik (it would, however, conform to the &quot;Marvel way&quot; of comics creationÃ¢â‚¬â€art firstÃ¢â‚¬â€akin to Kirby's creation of Silver Surfer without initial input from Stan Lee). In issue #6, Mantlo introduced the concept of &quot;Duckworld,&quot; which Gerber loathed. It depicted an all-duck parallel earth in which there were equivalents of all famous people, such as &quot;Ducktor Strange&quot; (a parody of Doctor Strange) who later appeared in She-Hulk (vol. 2 #19) and Truman Capoultry (Truman Capote), who narrated the issue. As Gerber told Mediascene, &quot;Howard's world, which would never be depicted visually, was inhabited by other anthropomorphized animals like himself. Like the cartoon worlds of Disney and Warner Brothers. Unlike the Disney and Warners worlds, however, Howard's reality was beset with the same plethora of social ills and personal vicissitudes which human beings confront daily. And the same, or similar, laws of nature applied there, too.&quot; The first story of issue #9, written by Bill Mantlo, had Howard walk away from Beverly, and what happened to him next was documented in a story by Steve Skeates the same issue. Steven Grant followed this with a story in Bizarre Adventures #34, in which the suicidal Howard is put through a parody of It's a Wonderful Life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce4d148e90da680af5c76590b21b780ec471858","amp;dn":"Howard+the+Duck+Magazine+%23+1-9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce4d148e90da680af5c76590b21b780ec471858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,228,209,72,233,13,166,128,175,92,118,89,11,33,183,128,236,71,24,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
