The residents of Storybrooke have lived an unchanging existence for 28 years, unaware of their own lack of aging. The town's only hope lies with a bail bondswoman, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who was transported from the fairy tale world before she could be cursed. As such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories, aided by her son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), with whom she has recently reunited (after giving him up for adoption upon his birth), and his book of fairy tales that holds the key to ending the curse. Henry is also the adopted son of Regina (who is the mayor of Storybrooke), providing a source of conflict between the two women.\n\nEach episode focuses on a character backstory. One segment details the character's past life that, when serialized, adds a piece to the puzzle about the primary and/or secondary characters and their connection to the events that preceded the curse and its consequences. The other, set in the present day, follows a similar pattern with a different outcome but also offers similar insights. In addition, another storyline follows the results of what had happened after the curse took place and after it was broken by Emma.\n\nOn May 10th, 2013, the series was renewed for a third season and a greenlight for the spin-off tentatively titled Once Upon a Time in Wonderland was given by ABC. Both shows are set to air this coming fall.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa3c3f78631877e8650155258a7fca0c15b7b539","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Time+Season+2+episodes+14-22+with+specials+XviD+%5BJKS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa3c3f78631877e8650155258a7fca0c15b7b539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,60,63,120,99,24,119,232,101,1,85,37,138,127,202,12,21,183,181,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
