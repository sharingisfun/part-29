This book looks in detail at a wide selection of mathematical models in physiology, showing how physiological problems can be formulated and studied mathematically, and how such models give rise to interesting and challenging mathematical questions. With its coverage of many recent models it gives an overview of the field, while many older models are also discussed, to put the modern work in context. \n\nIn this second edition the coverage of basic principles has been expanded to include such topics as stochastic differential equations, Markov models and Gibbs free energy, and the selection of models has also been expanded to include some of the basic models of fluid transport, respiration/perfusion, blood diseases, molecular motors, smooth muscle, neuroendrocine cells, the baroreceptor loop, turboglomerular oscillations, blood clotting and the retina.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b95e0323cba60d3a1dd0e71be8516764c3934ede","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Physiology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b95e0323cba60d3a1dd0e71be8516764c3934ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,94,3,35,203,166,13,58,29,208,231,27,232,81,103,100,195,147,78,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
