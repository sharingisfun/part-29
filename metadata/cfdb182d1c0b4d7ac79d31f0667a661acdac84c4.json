Myths are proved true, probable, possible, improbable or busted. Often after the real-world practical tests have proved or debunked a Myth, the team will take the experiment to the extreme, many times using more modern technology than the myth could have used or upping the black powder for impressive explosions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfdb182d1c0b4d7ac79d31f0667a661acdac84c4","amp;dn":"MythBusters.S12E06.Motorcycle.Water.Ski.HDTV.x264-KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfdb182d1c0b4d7ac79d31f0667a661acdac84c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,219,24,45,28,11,77,122,199,157,49,240,102,122,102,26,205,172,132,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
