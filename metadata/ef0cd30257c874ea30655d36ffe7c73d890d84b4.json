Their music is characterized by a pirate theme, and as a result they have been dubbed a &quot;pirate metal&quot; band by many critics and their fanbase. They refer to their genre as &quot;True Scottish Pirate Metal&quot;.\n\nThe band formed under the name Battleheart in 2004. After releasing two demos, they were signed by Napalm Records in 2007 and renamed themselves Alestorm. Their debut album was released on 25 January 2008. The band's third album, Back Through Time, was released in June 2011, with their latest record Sunset on the Golden Age released in August of 2014.1. \tIntro \t02:38 \t \n2. \tThe Quest \t04:51 \t \n3. \tThe Sunk'n Norwegian \t04:36 \t \n4. \tLeviathan \t06:41 \t \n5. \tShipwrecked \t04:24 \t \n6. \tOver the Seas \t04:44 \t \n7. \tMidget Saw \t04:08 \t \n8. \tNancy the Tavern Wench \t06:15 \t \n9. \tPirate Song \t05:36 \t \n10. \tBack Through Time \t06:25 \t \n11. \tWenches &amp; Mead \t04:55 \t \n12. \tDeath Throes of the Terrorsquid \t09:44 \t \n13. \tKeelhauled \t04:41 \t \n14. \tRumpelkombo \t03:41 \t \n15. \tSet Sail and Conquer \t09:32 \t \n16. \tCaptain Morgan's Revenge \t09:08 \t \n17. \tRum \t04:18 \t \n18. \tOutro \t04:14 \t \n19. \tChunder Down Under \t44:20 \t \n20. \tIn the Navy (Village People cover) \t04:04 \t \n21. \tRumpelkombo \t00:04 \t \n ..............................................................................................If you seed it will stay.......seed......seed..................seed................................seed......................","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0cd30257c874ea30655d36ffe7c73d890d84b4","amp;dn":"Alestorm+-+Live+At+The+End+Of+The+World++MP3++320k++ak6103+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0cd30257c874ea30655d36ffe7c73d890d84b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,12,211,2,87,200,116,234,48,101,93,54,255,231,199,61,137,13,132,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
