All of the songs in the second set were debuts other than Winterqueen, which was played by TAB on October 1, 2011. Wingsuit ended with Mike on power drill. Monica, Snow and Amidst the Peals of Laughter were all performed acoustic, and Amidst the Peals of Laughter was performed as a Page and Trey duet. Wombat featured the dance stylings of Abe Vigoda and the Abe Vigoda Dancers. Antelope also featured an Abe Vigoda Dancers reference. After the second set concluded, a short parody video of scenes from The Godfather was played featuring Abe Vigoda and the members and crew of Phish.\n\nSetlist and notes from phish.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:895873280aa5592cfe9816235959f7976bec33aa","amp;dn":"Phish+-+2013.10.31+-+Boardwalk+Hall%2C+Atlantic+City%2C+NJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"895873280aa5592cfe9816235959f7976bec33aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,88,115,40,10,165,89,44,254,152,22,35,89,89,247,151,107,236,51,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
