Co-produced by Russell and keyboardist Barry Walsh, and recorded in Tucson, Texas, Nashville and Los Angeles, Mesabi features contributions from Calexico, Van Dyke Parks and Lucinda Williams, the last of whom guest on a cover of Bob Dylan's A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall. A consummate storyteller, Russell has amassed a devoted following that cherishes his vivid, novelistic tales evoking the spirit of the American experience in tightly constructed, panoramic vignettes.
