Although I would have loved to see more details of each of the films, just looking at the original models and hearing Ray talk about some of the issues (like the phone ringing in the middle of his working on Medusa for Clash of the Titans, then coming back and forgetting which snake head went which direction) was awesome. I didn&amp;#039;t know that he and Ray Bradbury was such great friends. My favorite part of the whole film, though, was seeing Tom Hanks pronounce &quot;Some people say Casablanca or Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time. I say Jason and the Argonauts.&quot; Excellent.\n\nDVD Rip Please help seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0774e6852ab8a1db210b747113c341f2129f071","amp;dn":"The+Harryhausen+Chronicles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0774e6852ab8a1db210b747113c341f2129f071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,119,78,104,82,171,138,29,178,16,183,71,17,60,52,31,33,41,240,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
