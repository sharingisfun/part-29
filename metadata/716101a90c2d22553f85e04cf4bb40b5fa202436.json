Two centuries on, he is still revered as a prophet of the modern world, yet he is also blamed for the darkest atrocities of modern times. But no matter in what light he is cast, the short, but broad-shouldered, bearded Marx remainsÃ¢â‚¬â€as a human beingÃ¢â‚¬â€distorted on a Procrustean bed of political Ã¢â‚¬Å“isms,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ perceived through the partially distorting lens of his chief disciple, Friedrich Engels, or understood as a figure of twentieth-century totalitarian Marxist regimes. \n\nAlready hailed by Publishers Weekly as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a major work . . . likely to be the standard biography of Marx for many years,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Karl Marx promises to become the defining portrait of a towering historical figure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716101a90c2d22553f85e04cf4bb40b5fa202436","amp;dn":"Karl+Marx%3A+A+Nineteenth-Century+Life+%5BKindle%2Fmobi+RETAIL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716101a90c2d22553f85e04cf4bb40b5fa202436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,97,1,169,12,45,34,85,63,133,224,76,244,187,64,181,250,32,36,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
