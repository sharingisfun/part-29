The film was directed by Louis Gasnier and starred a cast composed of mostly unknown bit actors.\n\nOriginally financed by a church group under the title Tell Your Children, the film was intended to be shown to parents as a morality tale attempting to teach them about the dangers of cannabis use.[1] However, soon after the film was shot, it was purchased by producer Dwain Esper, who re-cut the film for distribution on the exploitation film circuit.[1] The film was then reissued under several titles in addition to Reefer Madness, including Dope Addict, Doped Youth, Love Madness, and The Burning Question.[1][2] The film did not gain an audience until it was rediscovered in the 1970s and gained new life as a piece of unintentional comedy among advocates of cannabis policy reform.[1][3] Today, it is in the public domain in the United States and is considered a cult film.[3] It inspired a musical satire, which premiered off-Broadway in 2001, and a film based on the musical in 2005.\n\n\nCheck this account for update regularly :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:473f022cfaf5b02082d1c7d88fe8f8eb93e9680c","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Collection+-+Reefer+Madness+%281936%29+-+Colorized+and+Rest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"473f022cfaf5b02082d1c7d88fe8f8eb93e9680c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,63,2,44,250,245,176,32,130,209,199,216,143,232,248,235,147,233,104,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
