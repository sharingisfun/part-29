It's fifteen years after the Civil War, and the Hubbards dominate their small Southern town financially, if not socially; The patriarch of the family (Fredric March) sold salt for $8 a pound to the Confederate Army at a time when they needed it most. Edmond O'Brien and Dan Duryea play his sons, the former as mean as his father, the latter and younger one a weakling. When the elder child finds out that his father was responsible for the death of Southern troops during the war, he threatens to expose the truth unless the family fortune is placed in his hands. In the end, only Hubbard's wife (Florence Eldridge) stands by her husband during his inevitable fall, and she banishes her own children from their house. Brilliant acting by all, especially March, Duryea, and O'Brien, plus a sharp script, make this unrelentingly grim melodrama fascinating to watch. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040102/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040102/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:46:26\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 608x448 1.36:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1128 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 125 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb4328fcc02f92818969afb10ba1e33ecd91865","amp;dn":"Another+Part+of+the+Forest+%281948%29+Fredric+March+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb4328fcc02f92818969afb10ba1e33ecd91865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,180,50,143,204,2,249,40,24,150,154,251,16,186,30,51,236,217,24,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
