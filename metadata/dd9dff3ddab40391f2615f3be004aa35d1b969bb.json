Of course, there are problems in shipping, and the quartet ends up in Madagascar instead.  While the story may seem a bit simple, the real glue behind this project is not the story, or even the animation, which is very good ...\n\nThe glue holding this film together into a great animated film is the voice talent behind these characters!  Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith hold down the four major roles while Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andy Richter fill out the other three mid-major roles.  With such an all-star cast of comedic talent, the characters come to life and the story comes with it.\n\nIn 2008, the sequel was released, following those characters as they try to fly a rebuilt plane off the island of Madagascar, only to crash land in Africa.  In this second film, Bernie Mac and Alec Baldwin joined the cast, making the film even better and funnier.\n\nIf you've never seen either of these films, this is a great opportunity to download them.  Also, just for kicks, I've included the short film which came with the DVD of Madagascar entitled The Madagascar Penguins in &quot;A Christmas Caper&quot; which stars the Penguins of Madagascar and Ted the Polar Bear.  Enjoy!\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMadagascar\nPoster Art: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/pmadagascar1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/pmadagascar1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nVideo Resolution.....: 640 x 352\nVideo Frames/Second..: 23.98\nVideo Bitrate........: 1.12 Mbps\nIMDB Link............: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351283/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAt New York's Central Park Zoo, a lion, a zebra, a giraffe, and a hippo are best friends and stars of the show.

When their vessel is hijacked, however, the friends, who have all been raised in captivity, learn first-hand what life can be like in the wild.\n\nScreen Shots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas12.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas12.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas13.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas13.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas14.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas14.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas15.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/madgas15.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe Madagascar Penguins in &quot;A Christmas Caper&quot;\nPoster Art: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/pmadagascarpenguinsthe-achristmasca.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/pmadagascarpenguinsthe-achristmasca.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nVideo Resolution.....: 640 x 348\nVideo Frames/Second..: 23.00\nVideo Bitrate........: 1.13 Mbps\nIMDB Link............: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484439/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484439/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOne of the Madagascar penguins feels sorry for a lonely polar bear at Christmas, so he goes to buy him a present from the town.
