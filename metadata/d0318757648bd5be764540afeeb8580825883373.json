SonnyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in prison for a dozen years, nearly half his life. The inmates who seek out his uncanny abilities to soothe leave his cell feeling absolved. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know or care that Sonny has a serious heroin habitÃ¢â‚¬â€or where or how he gets his uninterrupted supply of the drug. Or that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serving time for other peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ crimes.\n\nSonny took the first steps toward addiction when his father took his own life rather than face exposure as a corrupt cop. Now Sonny is the seemingly malleable center of a whole infrastructure of corruption: prison staff, police, lawyers, a desperate priestÃ¢â‚¬â€all of them focused on keeping him high and in jail. And all of them under the thumb of the Twin, OsloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crime overlord. As long as Sonny gets his dope, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happy to play the criminal and the prisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in-house savior.\n\nBut when he learns a stunning, long-hidden secret concerning his father, he makes a brilliantly executed escape from prisonÃ¢â‚¬â€and from the person heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d let himself becomeÃ¢â‚¬â€and begins hunting down those responsible for the crimes against him . . . The darkly looming question is: Who will get to him firstÃ¢â‚¬â€the criminals or the cops?\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
