How do you get people to stick around long enough to see how your service might be of value? In Seductive Interaction Design, speaker and author Stephen P. Anderson takes a fresh approach to designing sites and interactions based on the stages of seduction. This beautifully designed book examines what motivates people to act.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\nAESTHETICS, BEAUTY, AND BEHAVIOR: Why do striking visuals grab our attention? And how do emotions affect judgment and behavior?\r\nPLAYFUL SEDUCTION: How do you create playful engagements during the moment? Why are serendipity, arousal, rewards, and other delights critical to a good experience?\r\nTHE SUBTLE ART OF SEDUCTION: How do you put people at ease through clear and suggestive language? What are some subtle ways to influence behavior and get people to move from intent to action?\r\nTHE GAME OF SEDUCTION: How do you continue motivating people long after the first encounter? Are there lessons to be gained from learning theories or game design?\r\nPrinciples from psychology are found throughout the book, along with dozens of examples showing how these techniques have been applied with great success. In addition, each section includes interviews with influential web and interaction designers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:585256525ec9d195cb0a1bf0f095f3aa3537cd7c","amp;dn":"Seductive+Interaction+Design+-+1st+Ed+%282011%29+%28Pdf%2CEpub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"585256525ec9d195cb0a1bf0f095f3aa3537cd7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,82,86,82,94,201,209,149,203,10,27,240,240,149,243,170,53,55,205,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
