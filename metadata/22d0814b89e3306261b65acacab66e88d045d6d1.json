Richard Bedford &quot;Thing Called Love&quot; Official Music Video \nFrom: aboveandbeyondtv  | Apr 28, 2011  \n\n\n\nPreview other mixes of 'Thing Called Love':\n\n&quot;There's a thing called love, that we all forget\nAnd it's a wasted love, that we all regret\nYou live your life just once\nSo don't forget about a thing called love&quot;\n\nDrawing on the song's poignant lyrics about unspoken love, the official music video for 'Thing Called Love' is all about those 'Sliding Doors' moments when love slips through the grasps of those chasing it. A tale of frustrated pursuit, the action follows a young man desperately racing to meet the object of his affections in a lively rock gig -- where he is met with Above &amp; Beyond performing a subtle cameo as the band. \n\nReaching that moment of truth when all he has to do is find the girl and tell her how he feels, the lead male finds himself repeatedly frustrated as his efforts are thwarted -- first by the swaying crowds and ultimately by a gang of thugs who eject him from the building. \n\nLike Above &amp; Beyond's recent crossover smash 'Sun &amp; Moon', the office music video for 'Thing Called Love' is again directed by the talented Ferry Gouw - whose previous credits involve working with Major Lazer, Late Of The Pier and Mystery Jets.\n\nAbove &amp; Beyond 'Thing Called Love' is available now as a pre-order CD single that includes the Extended Radio Mix, Above &amp; Beyond's 2011 Club Mix and the Extended Album Mix, as well as remixes from Mat Zo and Andrew Bayer. More mixes will be announced shortly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d0814b89e3306261b65acacab66e88d045d6d1","amp;dn":"Above+%26+Beyond+feat.+Richard+Bedford+-+Thing+Called+Love+mp4.HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d0814b89e3306261b65acacab66e88d045d6d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,208,129,75,137,227,48,98,97,182,90,202,202,182,110,136,208,69,214,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
