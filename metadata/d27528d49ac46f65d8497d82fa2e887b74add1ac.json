Danny is a golden boy in every way. He has dreamy blue eyes and blonde hair that always looks perfect, even when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s windblown or been stuck under a football helmet. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the boy every girl crushes on. The boy I get into trouble with, the boy I fight with, the hot quarterback no girl can resist, not even me. Being with Danny is like being on an adventure. He has a bright, contagious smile and abs to die for. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty much irresistible.\n\nEqually crush worthy is Phillip. Adorable, sweet Phillip, who I have known since birth.  Phillip has dark hair, a perfect smile, brown eyes, and the sexiest voice I have ever heard. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the boy I talk to every night before I go to sleep. The boy who rescues me, the boy who can read my mind, the boy who is always there for me, the boy who tries to keep me out of trouble, the boy who irritatingly keeps getting hotter, and whose strong arms always seem to find their way around me.  And when he gives me that grin, I can never say no.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - May 16th 2011 \n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d27528d49ac46f65d8497d82fa2e887b74add1ac","amp;dn":"That+Boy+by+Jillian+Dodd+%28That+Boy+01%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d27528d49ac46f65d8497d82fa2e887b74add1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,117,40,212,154,196,111,101,216,73,125,130,250,46,136,123,116,173,209,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
