Using a small packet of cards,\nyou start spelling out cards in the usual manner, however every time\nyou hand the cards to a spectator to try - he gets the Joker! Each\ntime he does, you immediately take the cards back and successfully\nspell to the card. The effect and comedy build as the spectator fails\nover and over - until he is finally left holding just the Joker. Now\nget this, the entire effect is virtually self-working and uses only\nregular, ungimmicked cards. No sleights. No extra cards. And no dodgy\nmoves whatsoever. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, this is one of those rare card tricks\nthat be used for any size or type of audience using poker-size play\n-\ning cards up to jumbos for optimum visibility on stage. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also one\nyouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll master in minutes!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab4f247f7c86c0630c45d343975236965377840","amp;dn":"The+Persistent+Joker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab4f247f7c86c0630c45d343975236965377840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,180,242,71,247,200,108,6,48,196,93,52,57,117,35,105,101,55,120,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
