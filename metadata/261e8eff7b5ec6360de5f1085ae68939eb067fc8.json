An evolutionary perspective can provide one framework for unifying and advancing the sciences, and chemistry has made important contributions to our understanding of evolution. Chemists today use principles of evolution and take lessons from chemistry in nature to advance modern chemistry in areas such as agriculture, energy, new materials, and pharmaceuticals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261e8eff7b5ec6360de5f1085ae68939eb067fc8","amp;dn":"Chemical+Evolution+across+Space+and+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261e8eff7b5ec6360de5f1085ae68939eb067fc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,30,142,255,123,94,198,54,13,229,241,8,90,230,137,57,235,6,127,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
