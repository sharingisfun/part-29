But the interactive and animation tools that make InDesign great for designing ebooks and apps also happen to be ideal for designing wireframes and prototypes. In this installment of UX Design Tools, Justin Putney shows how to use InDesign's grid and guides to align wireframe objects, create shapes, save and reuse text and object styles, and add interactivity and motion to your designs. Plus, learn how to create alternative layouts and liquid layouts that automatically scale when displayed on different devices, and build a library of reusable artwork.\nTopics include:\n\nSetting up your InDesign files\nCreating shapes\nStacking and grouping artwork\nAdding placeholder text\nAdding interactivity and motion to wireframes\nCreating responsive wireframes\nUsing master pages and object styles\nExporting wireframes for clients and developers\n\nUX Design Tools: Illustrator\n1h 11m Intermediate Mar 11, 2014\n\nThe UX Design Tools series connects early UX creative processesÃ¢â‚¬â€like wireframing and prototypingÃ¢â‚¬â€with the tools and techniques necessary to create a successful product design. Illustrator is one of those tools, noteworthy for its type tools, spacious artboard, libraries of reusable artwork, and clean vector lines. In this course, Justin Putney shows how to use symbols to take advantage of reusability, organize your artwork into layers, use artboards to design different wireframes for multiple screens and different application states, and export wireframes to share with clients and developers.\nTopics include:\n\nCreating and positioning guides\nBuilding shapes\nDesigning reusable symbols\nCreating character and paragraph styles\nAdding text\nUsing artboards to organize and display content\nExporting to multipage PDF\n\n\nUX Design Tools: Photoshop\n53m 24s Intermediate Mar 04, 2014\n\nThe UX Design Tools series makes the connection between early UX creative processes, like wireframing and prototyping, with the tools and techniques necessary to create a successful product design. This installment delves into the power of Adobe Photoshop. Justin Putney shows you how to create and edit live shapes, a key component in wireframes; store and display different application states with layer comps; export images and multilayer comps for sharing with clients and developers; and much more.\nTopics include:\n\nSetting up files\nBuilding live shapes with the Rectangle tool\nUsing character and paragraph styles\nOrganizing content into layers\nBuilding layer comps\nCreating and reapplying custom shapes\nUsing Smart Objects to group and store elements\nSaving and using layer effects\nExporting artwork","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8471c7d9a30894b0fdf63363f4f9cc18efd67ced","amp;dn":"Lynda.com_UX+Design+Tool+via+IDD_AI_PSD+by+Justin+Putney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8471c7d9a30894b0fdf63363f4f9cc18efd67ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,113,199,217,163,8,148,176,253,246,51,99,244,249,204,24,239,214,124,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
