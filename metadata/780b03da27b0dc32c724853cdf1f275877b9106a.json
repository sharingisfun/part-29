Natural gas hydrate is primarily composed of water and methane. These are solid, crystalline, ice-like substances found in permafrost areas and deepwater basins around the world. They naturally occur in the pore space of marine sediments, where appropriate high pressure and low temperature conditions exist in an adequate supply of gas (mainly methane). Gas hydrates are considered as a potential non conventional energy resource. Methane hydrates are also recognized as, an influence on offshore platform stability, a major factor in climate change contributing to global warming and a significant contribution to the ocean carbon cycle. The proposed book treats various geophysical techniques in order to quantify the gas hydrate reserves and their impact on environment. The primary goal of this book is to provide the state of art for gas hydrate exploration. The target audiences for this book are non-specialist from different branches of science, graduate students and researchers.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 281 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (October 11, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642142338\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642142338","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:780b03da27b0dc32c724853cdf1f275877b9106a","amp;dn":"Exploration+of+Gas+Hydrates+-+Geophysical+Techniques%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"780b03da27b0dc32c724853cdf1f275877b9106a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,11,3,218,39,176,220,50,199,36,133,60,223,31,39,88,119,185,16,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
