As the burgeoning rebellion reaches the palace gates, Marie Antoinette finds her privileged and peaceful life swiftly upended by violence. Once her loyal subjects, the people of France now seek to overthrow the crown, placing the heirs of the Bourbon dynasty in mortal peril.\n\nDisplaced to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, the royal family is propelled into the heart of the Revolution. There, despite a few staunch allies, they are surrounded by cunning spies and vicious enemies. Yet despite the political and personal threats against her, Marie Antoinette remains, above all, a devoted wife and mother, standing steadfastly by her husband, Louis XVI, and protecting their young son and daughter. And though the queen secretly attempts to arrange her familyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rescue from the clutches of the rebels, she finds that they can neither outrun the dangers encircling them nor escape their shocking fate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:021a8f6f6f25bb9a4ae4f5cf1a54cf57ac2a2726","amp;dn":"Confessions+of+Marie+Antoinette+-+Juliet+Grey+%28Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"021a8f6f6f25bb9a4ae4f5cf1a54cf57ac2a2726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,26,143,111,111,37,187,154,74,228,245,207,26,84,207,87,172,42,39,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
