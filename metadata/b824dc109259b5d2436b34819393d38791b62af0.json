Suicide, execution, industrial recklessness, ecological disaster and hunting accidents are some of the themes darkly illustrated in this body of work. The series contrasts sharply with Franquins other comic strips such as Gaston Lagaffe (Vakse Viggo), Spirou et Fantasio (Splint &amp; Co) and the Marsupilami (Spirillen).\n\n\n\nAnd as usual, if you like this, feel free to check out my other danish comic book torrents.\nAnd remember to keep sharing, Im tired of having seeded my torrents beween 33 and 100 times, and only seeing 0-2 other seeders :)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b824dc109259b5d2436b34819393d38791b62af0","amp;dn":"Franquins+Sorte+Sider","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b824dc109259b5d2436b34819393d38791b62af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,36,220,16,146,89,181,210,67,107,52,129,147,147,211,135,145,182,42,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
