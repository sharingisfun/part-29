He also was elected King of the Germans (formally King of the Romans) in 1257, though the Papacy prevented his confirmation. He established Castilian as a language of higher learning, founded universities (Salamanca and Toledo) and earned his nicknames &quot;el Sabio&quot; (&quot;the Wise&quot; or &quot;the Learned&quot;) and &quot;el AstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³logo&quot; (&quot;the Astronomer&quot;) through his own prolific writings, including Galician-Portuguese poetry.\n\nAlfonso X commissioned or co-authored numerous works of music during his reign. These works include the vast compilation Cantigas de Santa Maria (&quot;Songs to the Virgin Mary&quot;), which was written in Galician-Portuguese and figures among the most important of his works. The Cantigas form one of the largest collections of vernacular monophonic songs to survive from the Middle Ages. They consist of 420 poems with musical notation. The poems are for the most part on miracles attributed to the Virgin Mary. One of the miracles Alfonso relates is his own healing in Puerto de Santa MarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a.\n\nTomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s Luis de Victoria, sometimes Italianised da Vittoria (1548 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ August 20, 1611), was a Spanish composer of the late Renaissance. &quot;The Spanish Palestrina&quot;, as he is known, was the most famous composer of the 16th century in Spain, and one of the most important composers of the Counter-Reformation, along with Giovanni da Palestrina and Orlando di Lasso.Many commentators hear in his music a mystical intensity and direct emotional appeal, qualities considered by some to be lacking in the arguably more rhythmically and harmonically placid music of Palestrina.\n\nAlonso Lobo (February 25, 1555 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ April 5, 1617) was a Spanish composer of the late Renaissance. Although not as famous as TomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s LuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s de Victoria, he was highly regarded at the time, and Victoria himself considered him to be his equal.\nLobo's music combines the smooth contrapuntal technique of Palestrina with the sombre intensity of Victoria.\n\nCarlo Gesualdo, known as Gesualdo da Venosa (March 8, 1566 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ September 8, 1613), Prince of Venosa and Count of Conza, was an Italian music composer, lutenist and nobleman of the late Renaissance. He is famous for his intensely expressive madrigals, which use a chromatic language not heard again until the 19th century; and also for committing what are amongst the most notorious murders in musical history.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0dc6e9d970a8f282f3af949639fe36769c8f40b","amp;dn":"Alphonse+X+%281280%29+to+Gesualdo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0dc6e9d970a8f282f3af949639fe36769c8f40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,220,110,157,151,10,143,40,47,58,249,73,99,159,227,103,105,200,244,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
