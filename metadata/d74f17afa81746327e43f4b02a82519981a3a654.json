This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a yearlong journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool toward the upper echelons of New York society and the executive suites of CondÃƒÂ© Nast--rarefied environs where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve. \n\nWooed in turn by a shy, principled multi-millionaire and an irrepressible Upper East Side ne'er-do-well, befriended by a single-minded widow who is a ahead of her time,and challenged by an imperious mentor, Katey experiences firsthand the poise secured by wealth and station and the failed aspirations that reside just below the surface. Even as she waits for circumstances to bring Tinker back into her life, she begins to realize how our most promising choices inevitably lay the groundwork for our regrets.\n\nVisit us at - www.lfrg.co.vu (currently under construction, but feel free to visit, and make sure you leave feedback for us)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d74f17afa81746327e43f4b02a82519981a3a654","amp;dn":"Amor+Towles-Rules+of+Civility+LittleFairyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d74f17afa81746327e43f4b02a82519981a3a654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,79,23,175,168,23,70,50,126,67,244,176,42,130,81,153,129,163,166,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
