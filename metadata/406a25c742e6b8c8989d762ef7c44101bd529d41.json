The unRAR code is under a mixed license: GNU LGPL + unRAR restrictions.\n\nYou can use 7-Zip on any computer, including a computer in a commercial organization. You don't need to register or pay for 7-Zip.\n\n\nThe main features of 7-Zip\n\nHigh compression ratio in 7z format with LZMA and LZMA2 compression\n\nSupported formats:\nPacking / unpacking: 7z, XZ, BZIP2, GZIP, TAR, ZIP and WIM\nUnpacking only: ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DEB, DMG, FAT, HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MBR, MSI, NSIS, NTFS, RAR, RPM, SquashFS, UDF, VHD, WIM, XAR and Z.\n\nFor ZIP and GZIP formats, 7-Zip provides a compression ratio that is 2-10 % better than the ratio provided by PKZip and WinZip\n\nStrong AES-256 encryption in 7z and ZIP formats\n\nSelf-extracting capability for 7z format\n\nIntegration with Windows Shell\n\nPowerful File Manager\n\nPowerful command line version\n\nPlugin for FAR Manager\n\nLocalizations for 79 languages\n\n\n7-Zip works in Windows 7 / Vista / XP / 2008 / 2003 / 2000 / NT / ME / 98.\nThere is a port of the command line version to Linux/Unix.\n\nOn 7-Zip's Source Forge Page you can find a forum, bug reports, and feature request systems.\n\n\nCompression ratio\n\nCompression ratio results are very dependent upon the data used for the tests.
