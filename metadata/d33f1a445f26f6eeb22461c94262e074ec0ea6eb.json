Botanists, zoologists, ecologists, geologists, volcanologists, seismologists, geomorphologists, meteorologists, climatologists, oceanographers, and many more are all environmental scientists in their own different ways, and their work has contributed greatly to the study of Earth science. Exploring such topics as the size of the Earth and how its lands and seas are distributed, &quot;Earth Science&quot; discusses the history of this planet, from the study of fossils to the development of the theory of plate tectonics. This exciting new book examines the Earth's history and how it came to be divided into the episodes making up the geologic time scale and includes the present version of that time scale.
