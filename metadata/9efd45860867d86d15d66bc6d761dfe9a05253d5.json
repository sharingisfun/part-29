There's probably no better choice than Yen for the headlining role of a hunted Jinyiwei commander, as the film offers plenty of opportunities for the martial arts superstar to flex his muscles. Further boosting the film's appeal are his attractive co-stars including Mainland actress Vicki Zhao (Red Cliff), Taiwan pop idol Wu Chun of Fahrenheit (Butterfly Lovers), Hong Kong Film Awards Best New Performer Kate Tsui (Eye in the Sky), and Singaporean actor Qi Yuwu (Painted Skin). Kung fu legend Sammo Hung, Shaw Brothers star Chen Kuan Tai, and veteran Hong Kong actors Wu Ma, Law Ka Ying, and Damian Lau round out the star-studded cast. Nominated for Best Action Choreography and Best Sound Design at the 29th Hong Kong Film Awards, 14 Blades was the top-grossing Chinese blockbuster during the 2010 Chinese New Year holidays. It is a remake of the 1984 Hong Kong film Police Pool of Blood.[citation needed] The theme song, which shares the same Chinese title as the film, is performed by Sa Dingding. \n\n\nTrailer : search utube\n\nR3 retail\n\nAudio :   (1) Mandarin  - Dolby Digital 5.1 - 448Kbps (Donnie Yen dub)\n          (2) Cantonese - Dolby Digital 2.0 - 192Kbps   (Donnie Yen original voice)\n\nSubs : English, Chinese\n\nSpecial features : Making of/Behind the Scenes\n\nNTSC\n\n112 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9efd45860867d86d15d66bc6d761dfe9a05253d5","amp;dn":"14+Blades+2010+DVDr-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9efd45860867d86d15d66bc6d761dfe9a05253d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,253,69,134,8,103,216,109,21,214,107,198,215,97,223,233,160,82,83,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
