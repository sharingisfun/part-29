Most regular titles (excluding weeklies and time displaced titles) jumped forward five years in time with special one-shot issues, telling stories in the timeline of the weekly The New 52: Futures End. Similar to Villains Month, each issue came with a special edition 3D cover, while cheaper, regular covers were available in standard 2D.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9fdb5da99d3cd3f9239f5166e885d3225e9dd2","amp;dn":"Futures+End+Month+%28One-Shots%29+%282014%29+%28Digital%29+%28Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9fdb5da99d3cd3f9239f5166e885d3225e9dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,159,219,93,169,157,60,211,249,35,159,81,102,232,133,211,34,94,157,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
