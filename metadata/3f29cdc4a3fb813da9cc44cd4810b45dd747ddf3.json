I was an excited young pup when we did this \\'record\\', my first tour in Europe, I especially loved France and moved to Paris a year later, in 1982, for what would turn out to be one of the best decisions of my life. \nThis recording date caught us a bit by surprise as I remember, we\\'d been doing \\'one-niters\\' for what seemed like forever, and then after the very last gig, when we thought we were leaving, we found out that they wanted to do this recording. We did the whole thing in basically one or two takes per tune, on a Sunday afternoon at Davout Studios in Paris. Some of the tunes were written on the spot, others we had lyrics for, but no \\'hook\\', or we had the \\'hook\\', but needed to put the lyrics together. Jimmy stayed up, most of the nite before the recording, re-working the lyrics on the tunes that he had ready. The album garnered the \\'Grand Prix du Jazz\\' award, and the \\'Big Bill Broonzy\\' awards in France that year.\\&quot;\n\nTracklist\n1. You Just a Baby Child (5:58 )\n2. Ruff Times (5:30)\n3.
