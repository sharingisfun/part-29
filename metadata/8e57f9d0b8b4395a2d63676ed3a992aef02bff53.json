More like Revenge of Double Dragon. Artificial Mind &amp; Movement's new side-scrolling beat-'em-up is a love letter to the original kung-fu fighter from 1987, right down to the Karate Kid-style brother protagonists in cheesy red and blue fighting togs. And like all good mash notes, this one includes a little bit of creativity: the developers have added some platform jumping, minigames, and basic puzzles to all of the punching-people-out stuff. So even though this downloadable game may be aimed straight at your nostalgia gene, it mixes in enough innovation to hold your interest through the moments that your brain tells you that you've done all this before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e57f9d0b8b4395a2d63676ed3a992aef02bff53","amp;dn":"REVENGE+OF+THE+WOUNDED+DRAGONS+%28NPUA30016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e57f9d0b8b4395a2d63676ed3a992aef02bff53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,87,249,208,184,180,57,90,45,99,103,110,211,169,146,174,240,43,255,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
