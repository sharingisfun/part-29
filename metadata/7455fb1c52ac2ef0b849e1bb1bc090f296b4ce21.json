Exceptional clear and crisp sounding, the mix is best played at moderate listening levels. \n\nThe original super audio CD was rECOnstructed using the high resolution lossless 5.1channel MLP 96khz/24bit audio which is not playable by 99% of modern CD, Blu-ray or DVD players due to hardware limitations and copy protection issues.  \n\nSince most peeps can't playback DTS-MA, the audio tracks are encoded to DTS-CORE 96khz-24bit lossy high resolution DTS codec to save bandwidth.  Most modern hi-fi receivers can decode this format as high resolution content without down converting but may require some adjustment of the blu-ray player output settings.   The difference in sound quality between the compressed 96/24 DTS and original MLP is barely audible.  Either way, the resulting sound clarity and realism is stunning.  FYI, for some unknown reason, VLC media player does not playback this DTS format.  WMP will playback provided proper codec (ffdshow, etc) is installed.\n\nThe disk is authored as an AVCHD suitable for either BD or DVD / AVCHD media.  Static titles are used for video.  Chapters points are included.  The content easily fits on a standard DVD-R single sided disk.\n\nSo others can be sure of the quality of this torrent, please come back and comment below after you have finished and played the contents.  This way others will know it's good and not a fake.  \n\n3ce202c83aff8ddcb6d1fc65d4da17b3f15098a4\nProduct Details\n\nArtist: Fleetwood Mac\nVideo format: Titles with chapters\nVideo: H264, uncropped, progressive, 1920 x 1080, 23.976fps\nAudio: English (DTS 5.1 high resolution 96/24 lossy)\nCompression: DTS 1536kbps 5.1 channel 96/24 high resolution core\nSubtitles: NA\nRegion: NA\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nRun Time: 44 minutes 48 seconds\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumours&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumours&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaNpkaafe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HaNpkaafe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSong List:\n\n1 SECOND HAND NEWS\n2 DREAMS\n3 NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN\n4 DON`T STOP\n5 GO YOUR OWN WAY\n6 SILVER SPRINGS (bonus)\n7 THE CHAIN\n8 YOU MAKE LOVING FUN\n9 I DON`T WANT TO KNOW\n10 OH DADDY\n11 GOLD DUST WOMAN\n12 SONGBIRD ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7455fb1c52ac2ef0b849e1bb1bc090f296b4ce21","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+Rumours+AVCHD+DTS5.1+High+Resolution+rECOn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7455fb1c52ac2ef0b849e1bb1bc090f296b4ce21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,85,251,28,82,172,46,240,184,73,225,187,27,192,144,242,150,180,206,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
