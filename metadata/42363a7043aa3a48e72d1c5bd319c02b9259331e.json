The calendar shows a monthly view and highlights the current day. If there are reservations then that day will be highlighted.  If the reservations go through the entire day, then the day will appear darker on the monthly view as opposed to a day that is not entirely booked.\n\nBasic PHP calendar (C) Copyright 2009 Alex Watson, All rights reserved.\nYou may modify and redistribute this work as long as these comments remain in the top of the source code files in this distribution of the calendar.\n\nNotes:\n\n- The username for the login page is &quot;userx&quot;\n- The password for the login is set to &quot;password&quot;\n\nYou can modify the above values which can be found near the bottom of the controlpanel.php file.
