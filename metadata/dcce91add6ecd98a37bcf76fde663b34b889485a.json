Some weeks the bakery makes so little dough that the staff doesn't get paid. Kerry quickly discovers that wasteful use of product and resources are to blame for the bakery's decline: She puts a stop to old ways and invigorates the staff with new treats and brings their decorations into the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 16-Apr-2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcce91add6ecd98a37bcf76fde663b34b889485a","amp;dn":"Save.My.Bakery.S01E05.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcce91add6ecd98a37bcf76fde663b34b889485a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,206,145,173,214,236,217,138,55,188,247,111,222,102,59,52,184,137,72,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
