NTSC\n\nHitler's Canadians tells the little known story of German POWs in Canada.\n\nIn the spring of 1940, small towns across Canada awakened to the sound of Nazi Jackboots. German soldiers, sailors and pilots marched down main streets to hastily constructed camps for some 40,000 POWs on Canadian soil.\n\nWith growing ranks of German prisoners and Nazi armies nearing it's shores, Britain saw POWs as a potential threat, and opted to send them to Canada. Between 1940 and 1946, there were 26 camps in Canada where POWs lived in relative luxuruy.\n\nFeatures numerous dramatic and hilarious escape attempts, the largest prison rebellion in Canadian history, and surprising interviews with former prisoners, whose words reflect the contradictory and complicated nature of the time.\n\nMost of the amenities described in this film were also present in German work camps, until the end of the war, when disease and starvation set in.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54c34ef86ce3d64c82f1e8ddde6db3758c2da60","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Canadians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54c34ef86ce3d64c82f1e8ddde6db3758c2da60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,76,52,239,134,206,61,100,200,47,30,141,221,230,219,55,88,194,218,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
