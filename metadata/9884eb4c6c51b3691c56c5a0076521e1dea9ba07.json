Featuring \ninterviews with Ozzy's brothers and sisters, as well as Jack, Sharon, Aimee and Kelly \nOsbourne. Featuring never-seen-before footage uncovered from the archives and interviews \nwith Sir Paul McCartney, Tommy Lee, Henry Rollins and others.\n\nOzzy Osbourne's four-decade track record as a culturally relevant musical artist is \nunprecedented, but his personal struggles have been shrouded in myth and secrecy. In some \nways, Ozzy's fame stems from his prodigious drug and alcohol intake, his musical \naccomplishments overshadowed by his 'madman' persona.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/f6bnk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/f6bnk.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n1h 33mn | 1.05 GiB | 720x400 | 1600 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 240 Kbps Vbr | 2 ch | QF 0.196","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9884eb4c6c51b3691c56c5a0076521e1dea9ba07","amp;dn":"BBC+-+God+Bless+Ozzy+Osbourne+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9884eb4c6c51b3691c56c5a0076521e1dea9ba07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,132,235,76,108,81,179,105,28,86,197,160,7,101,33,225,222,169,186,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
