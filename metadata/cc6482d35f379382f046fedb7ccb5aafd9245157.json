SCARLET! This is the comic experience of the year! The first creator owned series by one of the most successful teams in all of modern comics. Scarlet is the story of a woman pushed to the edge by all that is wrong with the world. A woman who decides to stand up and fight back. A woman who will not back down. A woman who discovers within herself the power to start a modern American revolution!! In the vein of Alias, Powers, and Jinx, Scarlet debuts a fascinating new comics character that, with every issue, reveals new things about herself against a completely original backdrop of intrigue and drama. Get in on the ground floor of the first creator owned series by Bendis since Powers, and the first creator owned series by Maleev...ever. (and, yes, the trademark obnoxious Bendis letter column will be here too).\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru, theProletariat, and ScanDog for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc6482d35f379382f046fedb7ccb5aafd9245157","amp;dn":"Scarlet+01+%282010%29+%281440px%2B2048px-HD%29+%28TaruTariat-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc6482d35f379382f046fedb7ccb5aafd9245157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,100,130,211,95,55,147,130,240,70,254,219,124,203,90,175,217,36,81,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
