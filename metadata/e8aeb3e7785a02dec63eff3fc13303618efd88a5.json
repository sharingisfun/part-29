It still plays well even to this day but it's\ngood to see that it's been given a new lease of life in this fast paced sequel.\nBasically this is more of the same - while that's a kiss of death cliche for\nmany sequels, in Tyrian's case it's a blessing. \nAll you need to worry about is turning the lights off, the sound up\nand getting your name up on the high score table. \nOpening up the basic arcade formula is the full game, which lets you buy weapon,\nshield and armor upgrades from money earned during each level.\nThis is considerably harder than the standard game but lets you have greater\nfirepower and defense systems later on - stock up on multiple side arms and\nsecondary weapons and you've got yourself a space-faring death machine.\nThe way the screen is filled with enemies, explosions and powerups is\nawfully pretty and at times a bit psychedelic - in other words,\nit looks the part of a classic blaster.\nA slightly dated but thoroughly playable shoot 'em up. \n\nFeatures:\nOver 65 levels that span 5 Episodes\nFull Game, Arcade and Timed Battle Modes\nSupports 1 or 2 players on the same PC\n3 Difficulty Levels\nOver One Dozen Hidden Levels and Modes\nThe Jukebox\nThe Ship Editor\n10 Ships\nOver 100 Weapons\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8aeb3e7785a02dec63eff3fc13303618efd88a5","amp;dn":"Tyrian.2000.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8aeb3e7785a02dec63eff3fc13303618efd88a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,174,179,231,120,90,2,222,198,62,255,63,193,51,3,97,142,253,136,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
