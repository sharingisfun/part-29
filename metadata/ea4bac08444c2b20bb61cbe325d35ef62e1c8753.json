Mainstays are Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar and Kirk Pengilly on guitar/sax. For twenty years, they were fronted by Michael Hutchence on lead vocals, whose &quot;sultry good looks&quot; and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their New Wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.\n\nINXS achieved international success with a series of hit recordings through the 1980s and 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, X and Welcome to Wherever You Are and the singles &quot;Original Sin&quot;, &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, &quot;Devil Inside&quot; and &quot;New Sensation&quot;.\n\nHutchence died in 1997 and INXS did not perform publicly for a year. The band made appearances with several guest singers including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002. In 2005, members of INXS participated in a reality television series, broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J. D. Fortune, and the release of &quot;Pretty Vegas&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot; as singles, and its album Switch.\n\nINXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992, and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. To date INXS have sold more than 30 million records.\n\nAlbums:\n\nINXS (1980)\nUnderneath the Colours (1981)\nShabooh Shoobah (1982)\nThe Swing (1984)\nListen Like Thieves (1985)\nKick (1987)\nX (1990)\nWelcome to Wherever You Are (1992)\nFull Moon, Dirty Hearts (1993)\nElegantly Wasted (1997)\nSwitch (2005)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4bac08444c2b20bb61cbe325d35ef62e1c8753","amp;dn":"INXS+-+Studio+Discography+1980+-+2005+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4bac08444c2b20bb61cbe325d35ef62e1c8753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,75,172,8,68,76,43,32,187,97,203,227,37,211,94,246,46,28,135,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
