Enjoy the show WWE Saturday Morning Slam wrestling fans. \n\nMy releases are in MP4 format with AAC 2 channel stereo audio instead of the MKV format with 5.1 channel AC3 Dolby Digital audio I was doing them in previously so that they are playable with VLC player as well as Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, iPhone, iPad, Sony Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones, and any other devices capable of playing 720p HD MP4 video files. \n\n\nIf you want this show in MKV format it is easy to convert it from MP4 to MKV using MKVtoolnix 2.2.0 (MKVmerge 2.2.0) which you can download from here: http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/win32/mkvtoolnix-2.2.0-setup.exe\n\nHere's how to do it: Download and install MKVMerge (Use link above). It is a free program that allows you to take video and audio files and convert them into MKV files on the fly, making it a very quick conversion.\n\nOpen MKVMerge on your computer, and you will be greeted by its home menu. Click the &quot;Add&quot; button that is near the top of the program, and a new window will appear giving you access to your computer's files. Locate your MP4 video and select it. Press &quot;Open,&quot; and it will load into MKVMerge.\n\nPress the &quot;Browse&quot; button at the bottom of the program, and a window will appear. Locate a place on your computer to save the new MKV file after it is created. Once you have found a place, click &quot;Save&quot; to save the location. Click the &quot;Start Muxing&quot; button at the bottom of the program and your MKV file will be created. Depending on the size of the file, it could take a few minutes. Once it is finished locate the MKV file after the program congratulates you on the conversion and play it as you would any other video file.\n\n\nEnjoy the WWE Saturday Morning Slam show wrestling fans and thanks for downloading my WWE Saturday Morning Slam HDTV 2012-09-22 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH release.
