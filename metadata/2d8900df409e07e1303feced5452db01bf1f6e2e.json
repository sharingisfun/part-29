The war will end any day. But when? The author of this thrilling but insightful journal is a Master Radar Controller and an Air Force Major directing bombers and fighters over North Vietnam from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Panama ControlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ atop Monkey Mountain. He helps vector battle-damaged warbirds to safety, and coordinates scary rescues of downed airmen. You read the scary actual radio transmissions. You feel youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re there when our first B52 is shot down, when disaster strikes the USS Midway aircraft carrier, and when the Viet Cong attacks a nearby leprosarium. EverythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complicated by low morale; failures of common sense, and dealing with Vietnamese sentries who repeatedly fall asleep at their posts. \nBy Christmas, the journalist is transferred to Pleiku in the Central Highlands as commander of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Peacock Control,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a small radar site where he helps control both American and Vietnamese aircraft - while the building shakes from rocket attacks. On Ceasefire Eve, February 1973, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s helping guard the site perimeter with two of his most trusted airmen, both African-American. \nThe journal takes you inside heart-wrenching orphanages; you read the adventures of a priest who endured Vietnamese communism, and learn about racism in the ranks. You savor Montgnaard Ã¢â‚¬Å“wineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ drinking ceremonies, and follow delicate close down activities required for getting out of Vietnam safely while dealing with the Vietnamese. \nThe journalist is forty years old, and father of six. Throughout the Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Only WarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ journal you share his excitement, fears, sensitivities, and innermost reflections Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as well as acid toned poems. Even so, humor abounds and brings many smiles. Photographs put you directly on scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d8900df409e07e1303feced5452db01bf1f6e2e","amp;dn":"My+Only+War+-+Bob+Lynn+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d8900df409e07e1303feced5452db01bf1f6e2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,137,0,223,64,158,7,225,48,63,236,237,84,82,219,1,191,31,110,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
