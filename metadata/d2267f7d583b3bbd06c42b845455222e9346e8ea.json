Copy the Ã¢â‚¬ËœDescent 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ folder to wherever you want to run it (recommend Applications folder). If you copy it to your Applications folder, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll show the D2X Rebirth in Launchpad (assuming youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on 10.7 or higher). \n\n*****FOR PC: ***** \n\nRun the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœd2x-rebirth-gl.exeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ application. Copy the Descent 2 folder to wherever you want to run it. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nMAX GRAPHICS SETTINGS\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom what I can see, the skyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the limit. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had it running at native 17Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MBP &amp; even Retina MBP resolutions on Mac without any issues. Make sure you pop up the other render settings as well for best graphics performance. Please mention here any incompatibilities for other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reference. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nISSUES/BUGS/INCOMPATIBILITES\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnly issue I ran into when testing it on a multiplayer/singleplayer was that the mouse settings for the 17Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MacBook Pro I used were completely screwed up. Built-in trackpad &amp; external mouse just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to work as it should, and it was uncontrollable. Had to use keyboard controls instead. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsidering this baby just needed a Pentium to run in Ã¢â‚¬â„¢96, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t imagine there are any problems with running it on an older system. Just for your reference however, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been tested on both Macs &amp; PCs.  \n\nWindows 7 Ultimate on: \n\n-\t15Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 2012 Retina MBP (BootCamp) \n-\t17Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Early 2011 MBP (BootCamp)\n-\tAlso on a few PCs at my workplace. ;)  \n\nOS X Native, tested on: \n\n-\t2005 PowerBook G4 1.67GHz 15Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (OS X 10.5 Leopard)\n-\t15Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 2006 Core Duo MacBook Pro 15Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard)\n-\t13Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 2007 MacBook Black (OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard)\n-\t15Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 2012 Retina MBP (OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion)\n-\t17Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Early 2011 MBP (OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion) \n\nWorks like a dream other than the mouse not working completely correctly on the 17Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MBP. Not sure why. Works fine on PPC &amp; Intel.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nONLINE PLAY INSTRUCTIONS\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVery simple to do. All you need to make sure is that you have a port forwarded for your computer (recommend port 42424 as D2 uses this by default). When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve forwarded the port, select Ã¢â‚¬ËœHost GameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in Multiplayer. Obviously make it visible to everybody if you want anyone to join.\n\nIf you want to use a different port to forward, go to Ã¢â‚¬ËœAdvanced OptionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ at the bottom of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœHost GameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ option before you start the game, and change the port number. Please be aware though that it will ALWAYS default back to 42424 when you start a new game. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nLAN PLAY INSTRUCTIONS\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to be any Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sorry! Just use Online Play instead. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2267f7d583b3bbd06c42b845455222e9346e8ea","amp;dn":"Descent+2+Rebirth+OS+X+%28Intel%2C+PowerPC%29+and+Windows+Compatible+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2267f7d583b3bbd06c42b845455222e9346e8ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,38,127,125,88,59,59,189,6,196,43,132,84,85,34,46,147,70,232,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
