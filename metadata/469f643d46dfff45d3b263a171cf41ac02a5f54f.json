At the beginning of June, Art Beckstein calls this the last summer of his life - after which he'll work as a stock broker. Art's father is the city's mob boss, steering Art's life, judging his choices. At a party, Art sees Jane, smart, blond, lovely. They meet; she has a boyfriend. The next day, Cleveland, the boyfriend, pulls Art from work and the summer of adventures begins. Cleveland lives close to the edge; he's explosive, with hints of problems with local thugs. The triangle of friendship gets complicated when Cleveland disappears for a couple weeks. Can Art sort out his feelings as well as help Cleveland? Where does his father fit in this?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469f643d46dfff45d3b263a171cf41ac02a5f54f","amp;dn":"Mysteries+of+Pittsburgh%2C+The+%282008%29+Gay+Interest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469f643d46dfff45d3b263a171cf41ac02a5f54f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,159,100,61,70,223,255,69,211,178,99,161,113,207,65,172,2,165,245,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
