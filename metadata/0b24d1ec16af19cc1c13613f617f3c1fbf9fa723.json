I was intrigued by the bootleg appearance of the cover &amp; label. When I played it I was blown away by the energy of the performances.\n\nWhile there are obviously better recorded concerts (from a technical perspective) this one has always been a favorite of mine and I was glad to see Classic Records do a re-issue of it.\n\nThere is a 2001 remaster of this concert released on CD that is more complete than this LP however it was remixed and futzed with.\n\nThis LP re-captures the original mix. It also has all of those crackling noises as heard on the original pressings. While I wanted to do a transfer of this LP for the original mix I also wanted to eliminate as many of those lead amp crackles &amp; pops as I could. That was the goal of this project. If you want a transfer that keeps all of the obnoxious pops in place, then this is not the download for you. I have manually removed those pops as well as any new vinyl-born pops.\n\nThis LP was transferred with my usual mid-fi system at 96kHz/32-bit float. De-popping is all done manually using Adobe Audition. As usual, there?s no N/R or EQ added. When the audio was ready it was dithered down to 16-bit wav files and from there to flac files. There will also be a 24-bit version of this torrent available as soon as the torrent has enough seeders.\n\nThis LP contains the following tracks:\n1)\tYoung Man Blues\n2)\tSubstitute\n3)\tSummertime Blues\n4)\tShakin? All Over\n5)\tMy Generation\n6)\tMagic Bus\n\nThe following are some notes regarding this LP that I?ve copied via the internet:\n\n??After repeated failed attempts on their &amp;#039;69-&amp;#039;70 UK Tommy tour, the hall on the campus of Leeds University was intentionally scheduled for the main purpose of recording a live album. The results, although only six selections from a much longer performance were used, were a triumph. Riding the crest of the Tommy album and their monumental appearance at the Woodstock Festival, the original quartet of Townshend, Daltrey, Entwhistle and Moon deliver a perfect mix. This Classic Records reissue includes all of the original artwork and packaging. Cut from the original two-track master tapes (amp lead pops and all) at Bernie Grundman Mastering by Chris Bellman on Classic&amp;#039;s all-tube cutting system, this 200g Super Vinyl Profile pressing brings new insight into the genius in the nuance that has previously been obscured - even on original track pressings used for comparison in mastering.?\n\nEnjoy.\n\n-DLedin\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b24d1ec16af19cc1c13613f617f3c1fbf9fa723","amp;dn":"The+Who%2C+Live+At+Leeds%2C+200-gram+vinyl+transfer%2C+16-bit+flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b24d1ec16af19cc1c13613f617f3c1fbf9fa723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,36,209,236,22,175,25,204,28,19,97,63,97,127,60,31,191,159,167,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
