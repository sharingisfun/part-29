In 1970 Richard Ploss (sax, flute) joined the band, and they took the name GUNS AND BUTTER.  In the summer of that year, Lenny Federer, a classically trained violinist, started jamming with them, and soon joined the band, which found a new musical direction.  The music of this bizarre Boston-based combo is a mixture of classical music, radio-friendly rock, jazz-rock, blues - and many other things.  They released one album in 1972 before falling into obscurity.\n\nThe album was released on Cotillion Records in 1972 and contained ambitious, well-arranged and inspired, jazzy progressive rock characterised by electric guitar and Hammond phrases mixed with violin, Ã¯Â¬â€šute and sax solo parts.  Guns &amp; Butter's line-up was predominantly Jewish, so Jewish traditional music featured in their sound, which made them distinctive.  Unfortunately, the record went completely unnoticed and as a result the band split up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79d0283f543d86e3b4a3e87cabfe2ed29875f81a","amp;dn":"Guns+%26amp%3B+Butter+-+same+%281972%29+%28mp3%2C+320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79d0283f543d86e3b4a3e87cabfe2ed29875f81a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,208,40,63,84,61,134,227,180,163,232,124,171,254,46,210,152,117,248,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
