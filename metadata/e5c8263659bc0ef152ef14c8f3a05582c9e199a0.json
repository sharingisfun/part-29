The other five demigods have to put aside their grief and follow Percy's instructions to find the mortal side of the Doors of Death. If they can fight their way through the Gaea's forces, and Percy and Annabeth can survive the House of Hades, then the Seven will be able to seal the Doors from both sides and prevent the giants from raising Gaea. But, Leo wonders, if the Doors are sealed, how will Percy and Annabeth be able to escape?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c8263659bc0ef152ef14c8f3a05582c9e199a0","amp;dn":"Heroes+of+Olympus+The+House+of+Hades","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c8263659bc0ef152ef14c8f3a05582c9e199a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,200,38,54,89,188,14,241,82,239,20,200,243,160,85,130,201,225,153,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
