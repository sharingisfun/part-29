Wells's War of the Worlds to Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles to the fiction of &quot;cyberpunks.&quot; In addition to enthralling readers with breathtaking narratives and dazzling the imagination with mind-bending glimpses of possible futures, the best science fiction asks essential questions: What does it mean to be human? Are we alone in the universe, and what does it mean if we're not? Esteemed professor Michael D.C. Drout traces the history of science fiction in this series of stimulating lectures. From Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to today's cutting- edge authors, Drout offers a compelling analysis of the genre, including a look at hard-boiled science fiction, the golden age of science fiction, New Wave writers, and contemporary trends in the field.\n\nMichael D.C. Drout is an associate professor of English at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, where he teaches courses in Old and Middle English, medieval literature, Chaucer, fantasy, and science fiction.\n\n14 Lectures\n30 minutes/lecture\n\n1 What Is Science Fiction?\n2 The Roots of Science Fiction\n3 Mysterious Lore, Marvelous Tech: The 1930s\n4 Hard-Boiled Science Fiction: The 1940s\n5 The Grand Master: Robert A.
