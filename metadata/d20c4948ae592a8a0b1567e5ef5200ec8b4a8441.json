Her mother, Diana, and niece, Ciera, are concerned that she may be mentally ill, but Tonya says sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not crazy. Can Dr. Phil help her quiet the noise in her head? Then, Laura says her 20-year-old son, Hunter, is either a con man, a pathological liar or is mentally ill. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at the root of his deceptions? \n\nPathological Liar, Con Man or Mentally Ill?\n\nLaura says her 20-year-old son, Hunter, often makes up elaborate lies, which include pretending to be the CEO of a multibillion dollar company, a professional wrestler Ã¢â‚¬â€ and even a cancer victim. Ã¢â‚¬Å“My sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behavior is so unusual and bizarre,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are times when I think he may be suffering from some type of mental illness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She says he often lives in a fantasy world, like when he pretends to teach a mock high school in her house Ã¢â‚¬â€ complete with lectures and homework. She also says he lied for a month and a half about working at a fast food restaurant before she confronted him. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I never ridiculed Hunter for what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done because I thought he would outgrow it eventually, and now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 20, and he hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.&quot; She continues, &quot;I blame myself for a lot of his behavior because Hunter doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the concept of consequences.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nType: TV Rip\nVideo format: MPEG-4 (MP4)\nAudio format: AAC 2ch stereo\nApproximate runtime: 42 minutes\nGenre: talk show\nAustralian air date: 24th June, 2013\n\n(commercials and promos removed)\n\n+includes MPC-HC thumbs+\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://drphil.com/shows/show/2005&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://drphil.com/shows/show/2005&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* please seed as much as possible after downloading to help keep this alive *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d20c4948ae592a8a0b1567e5ef5200ec8b4a8441","amp;dn":"Dr+Phil+Show+-+Crazy+or+Just+Complex+...+What%27s+Wrong+With+My+Lo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d20c4948ae592a8a0b1567e5ef5200ec8b4a8441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,12,73,72,174,89,42,138,11,21,103,229,239,82,0,236,139,74,132,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
