At first all is well and they all have a lot of fun (if you know what I mean!). Watching their fun is a mysterious stranger in a pickup truck, who has plans for some fun of his own that the youngsters aren't going to appreciate. (Written by Rob Hartill.) This is a VHS-Rip that has good quality to be from that, a VHS cassette. Sadly, it has 1.33 aspect ratio. Haven't seen any widescreen one yet. Hope some company releases it in DVD format soon. Love this desert-based slasher. Funny and violent at the same time.\n\nIMDb Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121556/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c10c5057860f879f35622f488ddc9a78ae73e274","amp;dn":"Mirage+%281990%29+VHS+Rip+%28Good+quality+for+VHS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c10c5057860f879f35622f488ddc9a78ae73e274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,12,80,87,134,15,135,159,53,98,47,72,141,220,154,120,174,115,226,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
