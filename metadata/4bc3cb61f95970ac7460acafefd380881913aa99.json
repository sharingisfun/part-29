The original album was heavily tweaked in the studio to hide out-of-tune and wrong notes as well as to add in a sheen of reverb to further obscure parts. These enhancements were removed for the compact disc re-issue in 1995.\nContents\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc3cb61f95970ac7460acafefd380881913aa99","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+London+Symphony+Orchestra+Vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc3cb61f95970ac7460acafefd380881913aa99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,195,203,97,249,89,112,172,116,96,172,175,239,211,128,136,25,19,170,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
