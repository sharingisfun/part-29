The band was formed in mid 2001 by 16 people, some from Orsa SpelmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤n, and Helen SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶holm and since 2004 Tommy KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rberg as singers.\n\nBAO includes some of Sweden's most experienced contemporary and folk musicians:\n\nBenny Andersson - accordion, piano, synclavier, etc.\nGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ran Arnberg - pipe organ, spinet\nJanne Bengtson - flute, piccolo, crumhorn, baritone saxophone\nPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r Grebacken - saxophones, clarinet, recorder, piccolo\nLeif GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ras - violin, cello, mandolin\nNicke (Nils-Erik) GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶the - violin, mandolin\nJogga (Jan-Anders) Ernlund - contrabass\nCalle Jakobsson - tuba, bassoon\nLeffe Lindvall - trumpet, cornet\nKalle Moraeus - violin, zither, guitar, banjo, etc.\nOlle Moraeus - violin, viola, mandolin\nPerra (Per-Erik) Moraeus - violin, mandolin, saxophone\nLars Rudolfsson - accordion\nJÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgen Stenberg - drums, percussion instruments\nTommy KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rberg - vocals, guitar\nHelen SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶holm - vocals\n\nAll members of the band are occupied in external capacities during the majority of the year, some in the theater orchestras in Stockholm. The brothers Moraeus, Leif GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ras and Nicke GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶the play together in Orsa SpelmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤n. During the summers the members of BAO meet up and rehearse, and then go out on mini-tours, to which tickets are highly sought after. The concept of these tours are A concert with dance, so a dance floor is brought along. Tommy KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rberg and Helen SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶holm together perform the vocals for the non-instrumental songs.\n\n- - -\n\nBeing a typical Benny Anderssons Orkester album, BAO 3 (the title indicates that it's the third BAO album) includes many different musical styles, ranging from Swedish folk music to pop, jazz, classical tunes and viennese influences. The album is officially credited to Benny Anderssons Orkester, Helen SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶holm &amp; Tommy KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rberg, indicating that it also includes several tracks with vocals. In fact, compared to its studio predecessor, BAO! in 2004, the amount of vocals tracks has increased. No less than seven out of the 12 tracks on the album are sung by either Helen SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶holm or Tommy KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rberg or as a duet. Tommy KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rberg can be heard on a BAO studio album for the first time , after already appearing together with the group during their tours and also lending vocals to two tracks on Benny Andersson's two solo albums from the 1980s, Klinga mina klockor and November 1989.\nAs usual, most of the lyrics were written by Benny's former ABBA partner BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Ulvaeus, while all the music was composed by Benny Andersson himself.\n\nBAO 3 was recorded in Sveriges Radios Studio 5 and Atlantis Studio, both in Stockholm, during 2007. Like all Benny Anderssons Orkester albums, it was engineered by Bernard LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶hr und subsequently mixed by him and Benny Andersson at Mono Music Studio.
