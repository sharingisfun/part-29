The Austin, Texas-based quartet might\nnot be the most prolific recording act, but they have churned out EPs, remixes,\nand full-lengths steadily since debuting in 2002 with Identification Parade.\nTheir fourth proper album, Hexadecagon, sits as the follow-up to 2009's Golden\nBeds EP and finds the band expanding its sounds and scope. The record has been\ndescribed as an attempt to create a more enveloping listening experience. In\nother words, that means plenty of instrumental layers filled with keyboards,\nsamplers, theremin, and everything else under the sun. Hexadecagon was recorded\nwith the assistance of producer John Congleton, who has worked with St. Vincent,\nExplosions in the Sky, and the Walkmen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5054fad7e901c19bbbe91b5cb07879e5a4571439","amp;dn":"The+Octopus+Project-Hexadecagon-2010-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5054fad7e901c19bbbe91b5cb07879e5a4571439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,84,250,215,233,1,193,155,187,233,27,92,176,120,121,229,164,87,20,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
