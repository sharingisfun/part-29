The four friends are snobbishly looked down upon by the college students of the town as &quot;cutters,&quot; since they were born in Bloomington and their parents worked in the local limestone quarries that built the university. Dennis Christopher's character Dave wants to be a champion bicycle racer and he idolizes the Italian racing team -- so much so that he speaks, thinks, and acts Italian, all to his father's (Paul Dooley) forlorn exasperation. Dave falls for a college girl (Robyn Douglass), but is ashamed to admit he is a cutter and poses as an Italian exchange student to impress her. Dave is particularly excited when his heroes -- the Italian racers -- come to town for a race. But they are even more snobbish than the college students and rely on dirty tricks to keep Dave from winning a race against them. After that ordeal, Dave throws away his false identity and convinces his friends to enter the university's &quot;Little 500&quot; bicycle race against the college students. This light-hearted and heartwarming tale was a surprising word-of-mouth success at the box-office and won several awards, including an Academy Award for &quot;Best Screenplay.&quot; \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078902/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078902/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=87893499-eb13-4c15-bf02-e81104a8d264&amp;k=breaking&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=87893499-eb13-4c15-bf02-e81104a8d264&amp;k=breaking&lt;/a&gt; away\n\n\n\nAwards:Won Oscar.
