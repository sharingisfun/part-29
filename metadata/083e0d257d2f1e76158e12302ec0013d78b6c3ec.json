Pure BodhrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡n brings together a virtual who's who of top traditional musicians. What began as a celebration of the bodhrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡n has actually evolved into one of the finest traditional music collections currently available.\n \nOver the last 30 years, bodhrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡n playing has developed into an entirely new voice in traditional Irish music. Today the bodhrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡n has become as much a symbol of Ireland as the harp, and this once humble drum is played today using highly innovative technique and tone, making it one of the most exciting instruments in Irish music. Pure BodhrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡n turns the spotlight on the bodhrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡n in its many roles. As a driving rhythmic accompaniment, as subtle or teasing embellishment to adorn music, lilt or song, as a tonal instrument in its own right or in a proud solo role.\n \nPure BodhrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡n has a packed agenda , built around music not just beat. Robbie Harris, Ronan O Snodaigh, Tommy Hayes , John Joe Kelly, Jimmy Higgins and a gentle Cathy Jordan complete disc 1.The second disc is reserved for the trail blazers including Christy Moore, Donal Lunny, Kevin Conneff, Johnny Mc Donough and Colm Murphy.
