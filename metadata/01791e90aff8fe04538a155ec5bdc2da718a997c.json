The lyrics were written by Marilyn Manson and the music by Twiggy Ramirez.\n\nThe Dope Show's single release was accompanied by a surrealistic music video directed by Paul Hunter, which began filming on August 8, 1998 and which premiered on August 20, 1998. In scenes reminiscent of The Man Who Fell to Earth, Manson appears ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ red-haired, with his entire body, including prosthetic rubber breasts, covered in white latex paint ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as an androgynous extraterrestrial wandering around the Hollywood Hills. He is captured, studied in a laboratory, and eventually transported by limousine to a stage where he and the other members of the band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the fictional band Omega and the Mechanical Animals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ perform the song in concert before hysterical fans who end up rioting and crossing the security barriers. Actor Billy Zane makes a cameo appearance in the limo sequence, as a recording industry executive. This same sequence features parodies of SPIN magazine (as &quot;Spun&quot; in the video) and The National Enquirer.\n\nThe video's imagery employs several direct homages to Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain, most specifically a sequence involving the destruction of plaster casts of the main character's body in a crucifixion pose. In addition, sculptural pieces by German artist Rebecca Horn are recreated such as &quot;Overflowing Blood Machine&quot; in which Manson is bound by long, red, blood flowing tubes. In the limo sequence, &quot;Cornucopia&quot; a construction which seems to join the mouth and breasts with a self-nursing effect.\n\nThe video won a 1999 MTV Video Music Award for &quot;Best Cinematography&quot;, as well as the &quot;Maximum Vision&quot; award. It was filmed on standard cinema-grade Kodak 35 mm film stock; the contrast, saturation, and color tinting were all altered dramatically to obtain its vintage look. The video was filmed over two weeks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ extreme in comparison to the industry standard of two days. Interscope Records funded the video, while HSI Productions produced and filmed it. Manson co-directed. Shooting began on Tuesday, August 8, 1998.\n\nThe &quot;Hollywood Hills&quot; scene with Manson walking outside was actually filmed in the city of Simi Valley in southern California. The building in the background is the House of the Book building at the Brandeis-Bardin Institute and was previously shown in the children's TV show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n\n&quot;The Dope Show&quot;'s performance sequence was filmed in front of the Los Angeles Municipal Traffic Court Building, South Hill Street by architect William Allen. The Brutalist architecture did not permit a reasonable angle or height from which to film; instead, the band was placed on top of the trailer of an 18-wheeler transport truck. Cameras situated on mechanical arms, and at a distance across the street, were used to film the dramatic concert shots. These scenes are interspersed with cuts of underground transvestite performer Johnnie Baima dancing in a yellow, sequined dress, similar to that worn by Twiggy Ramirez in the same video. The costumes for the video, including the dresses and Marilyn Manson's red, diamond-patterned boots (which featured a 6-inch sole and heel) were designed jointly by Manson and Terri King. The Goddess Bunny's custom couture sequine gown (worn for the video and the live MTV awards performance), was designed and hand sewn by Kris Hendrickson, aka littlemskris of San Francisco.\n\nThe video is available on a DVD included with some editions of Lest We Forget, as well as on the VHS compilation God Is in the TV, which also included &quot;uncensored&quot; outtake footage, such as Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy and the Goddess Bunny undressing in the back of a limousine.\n\nThe video reached #16 on MuchMusic's 50 Most Controversial Videos, for Manson's shocking appearance.\n\nAn alternate version of the video just featuring Manson and various close ups was released on the old Marilyn Manson website Marilyn Manson.net prior to the official release. Parts of this first video can be seen in the finished video. \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01791e90aff8fe04538a155ec5bdc2da718a997c","amp;dn":"Marilyn+Manson+-+The+Dope+Show+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01791e90aff8fe04538a155ec5bdc2da718a997c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,121,30,144,175,248,254,4,83,138,21,94,197,189,194,218,113,138,153,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
