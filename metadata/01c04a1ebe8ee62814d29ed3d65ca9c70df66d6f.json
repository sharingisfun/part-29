Five different calendar views (day, week, month, agenda, landscape day) give you a good overview over your upcoming events. To make rescheduling events easy, they can be moved or copied via drag&amp;drop in the day, week, month and landscape day view.\n\nAdditional features:\n- Drag&amp;Drop support to move, copy, open and delete events\n- Widgets to see your events on your home screen without opening the app: day widget (4x1), month widget (4x3, 4x4) and agenda widget (2x2, 2x3, 4x3). In the month 4x4 widget you can tap a single day to directly open it.\n- Zoomable month view\n- Configurable startup view (day, view, month, agenda)\n- When adding recurring events you can use the same rules that you can use in Google Calendar, e.g. you can create events &quot;on Monday and Thursday every two weeks&quot; or &quot;every last Friday in a month&quot;.\n- Direct sync with Google Calendar option e.g. to download all historical data and to be able to assign icons to events\n- Improved date picker that displays a whole month to choose a date\n- Search function\n- Customizable hardware buttons (e.g. you can assign the &quot;Today&quot; function to the &quot;back&quot; button)\n- Sync with Google Tasks\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works.\n- Repeatable, snooze-able reminders using a custom sound (e.g. an MP3 file from your phone) or one of the built-in sounds.\n\nWhat's in this version:\n- Icons can now be assigned to calendars (just tap the blue button under &quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;Visibility/Download&quot;)\n- A custom pattern for the reminder vibration can be configured (e.g. short-long-short).\n- The new improved time picker is enabled by default (&quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;Display and Use&quot;, &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Use improved time picker&quot;)\n- Bug fixes and speed improvements\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c04a1ebe8ee62814d29ed3d65ca9c70df66d6f","amp;dn":"CalenGoo+v1.0.84+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c04a1ebe8ee62814d29ed3d65ca9c70df66d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,192,74,30,190,142,230,40,20,210,158,211,214,92,169,199,13,246,109,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
