For Motor Man Dan, the ultimate would be to have his very own serial killer, to fulfill his sick, obsessive, murderous appetite. Ryan, the victim of a terrible accident who suffered severe head trauma, would be that missing piece to complete Motor Man's demented collection. Motor Man would then tool and manufacture a half machine, half man, serial killer, which he would then orchestrate and produce an assortment of killing scenarios. From director Craig McMahon comes this gruesome/slasher tale of a desolate man that took collecting serious. Written by Post Reel Pictures\n\nThis is a DVDrip from my collection, and I believe it is the only one on the net...so hopefully you all will enjoy it as much as I did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:410a080f6d7a7a67eb398b84b3fa20f2b6e9bd8d","amp;dn":"MachinedDVDrip.KweeF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"410a080f6d7a7a67eb398b84b3fa20f2b6e9bd8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,10,8,15,109,122,122,103,235,57,139,132,179,250,32,242,182,233,189,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
