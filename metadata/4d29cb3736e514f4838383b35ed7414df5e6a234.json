As such, all recipes are malt-syrup based (the simplest brewing method) with variations for partial-grain brewing. While recipes are included for classic beer styles -- ales and lagers -- Extreme Brewing has a unique emphasis on hybrid styles that use fruit, vegetables, herbs and spices to create unique flavor combinations. Once their brew is complete, readers can turn to section three, The Rewards of Your Labor, to receive guidance on presentation, including corking, bottle selection and labeling as well as detailed information on food pairings, including recipes for beer infused dishes and fun ideas for themed dinners that tallow the reader to share their creations with family and friends.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nSam Calagione is the founder and owner of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, DE, the nation's fastest growing independent brewery, and Dogfish Head Brewery and Eats in Rehoboth Beach, DE.
