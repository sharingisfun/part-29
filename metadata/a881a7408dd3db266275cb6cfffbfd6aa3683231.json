While the fascistic regime foretold by Orwell had not yet come to power the nation had been brought to its knees, the victim of repeated playings of Karma Chameleon and Sister Christian. The country needed something to believe in, something besides aerobics or Emmanuel Lewis' winning the People's Choice Award. And so they came, a ragtag group of heroes in a beat-up pickup, complete with a beat-up gun rack: Jed, Aardvark, Daryl, Arturo and their brave, though prone-to-sniveling compatriot Robert (played by the prone-to-sniveling C. Thomas Howell.) The dawn may have been a red one, but they would make sure that when the sun set, it would be red... white and blue!\n\nJoining Mike for this very special RiffTrax is Joel McHale, the Daryl to Mike's Arturo, or perhaps the Jed to his Aardvark, or maybe the Aardvark to his Daryl. The point is, it is the perfect partnership with which to assail the enemies of freedom, i.e., the makers of Red Dawn!\n\n*******************************************************************************\nAs always donate or purchase the MP3's fromto keep these coming, and of course, WOLVERINES!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a881a7408dd3db266275cb6cfffbfd6aa3683231","amp;dn":"Red+Dawn+1984+RiffTrax.subs.dual-audio.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a881a7408dd3db266275cb6cfffbfd6aa3683231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,129,167,64,141,211,219,38,98,117,203,108,255,251,253,106,163,104,50,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
