But the band is in very good form, with a little help from Ken Babbs who makes a few appearances and even dominates Babble (CD2, track 1). Vintage Dead. This version of the show is NOT how it went down in actuality, but rather my attempt to make a good 2-disc set from the worn and tattered files that were available. I salvaged the really good stuff. \n\nPlease note - the segue from TIFTOO into Sitting on Top of the World was done with a crossfade because tape warble made Jerrys guitar sound horrible and he kept playing on for a few more minutes as I recall.\n\nI think I remember patching over cuts in Lovelight and Dark Star by stitching segments together, and Doin That Rag fades out for good reason. He Was a Friend of Mine starts mid-solo after a cut in the master tape.\n\nOverall these sounded like improvements to me but anyone who suspects that the original untampered-with show is a better listening experience, or a more authentic experience,  is urged to visit the Internet Archive and stream the concert there. Enjoy the jarring, unmusical cuts and tape warble . . . :-)\n\nYour friend, \nZoticus\n\nCD 1\n 1 Hard to Handle\n 2 Cold Rain &amp; Snow\n 3 Green, Green Grass of Home\n 4 Me &amp; My Uncle\n 5 Thats It for the Other One\n 6 Sitting On Top of the World\n 7 It Hurts Me Too\n 8 Turn On Your Lovelight\n\nCD 2\n 1 Babble\n 2 He Was a Friend of Mine\n 3 Dark Star\n 4 Doin That Rag\n 5 Its All Over Now, Baby Blue\n 6 We Bid You Good Night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb193d71550dc07341715e7e09f873dd69030985","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+University+of+Oregon%2C+May+31%2C+1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb193d71550dc07341715e7e09f873dd69030985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,25,61,113,85,13,192,115,65,113,94,126,9,248,115,221,105,3,9,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
