Behind closed \ndoors, royal domestic life often seemed like a battlefield. \n\nIn a 60-year family saga this new three-part series explores the reign of \nVictoria through her personal relationships with her husband and her nine \nchildren. It is a story of manipulation, conflict, intimidation, emotional \nblackmail, and fevered attempts by her children to escape the clutches of their \ndomineering and needy mother.\n\nThe series uses a wealth of written material and photos left by Victoria, \nAlbert and their children, including letters, diaries, memoirs and journals, to \nbring the subject and characters to life. \n\nThis first episode focuses on Victoria's tempestuous relationship with Prince \nAlbert, their attempts to engineer the upbringing of their children and to save \nthe monarchy by projecting a modern image of the royal family.\n\n----\nFile|\n----\n\nMovie (AVI) Name ..: BBC Queen Victoria's Children 1 of 3 \n                     The Best Laid Plan 2013.avi \nTotal Size Bytes ..: 734,826,016 Bytes \nLength.............: 58:51.240 \nType...............: AVI(.AVI) \n\n-----\nVideo|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........: XVID\t\nCodec Name ........: XviD 1.1.2 Final\t\nBitrate ...........: 1536 \nResolution ........: 624 x 352 \nAspect Ratio ......: 1.773 \nFramerate .........: 25.000 \n\n-----\nAudio|\n-----\n\nCodec Name ........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nBitrate ...........: 128 KB/s (CBR) \nChannels ..........: 2 \nSampling Rate .....: 48000 Hz \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3f00b4634946a9315d4e6d2fd95350e4fe2be31","amp;dn":"BBC+Queen+Victoria%27s+Children+1+of+3+The+Best+Laid+Plan+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3f00b4634946a9315d4e6d2fd95350e4fe2be31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,240,11,70,52,148,106,147,21,212,230,210,253,149,53,14,79,226,190,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
