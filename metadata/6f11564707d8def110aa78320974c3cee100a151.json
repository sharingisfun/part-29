Even as a wee lassie, sick with a childhood illness, she had the power to spread smiles and laughter wherever she went. But when Lilyâ€™s beloved brother marries and becomes laird of the clan, Lily feels lost. Her once steadfast companion has little time for her, and his new wife has assumed the duties she used to carry out for the clan. While she couldnâ€™t be happier for her loved ones, she longs for something more for herself. In truth, she longs for her brotherâ€™s best friendâ€”the braw warrior sheâ€™s loved all her life.\r\n\r\nKyle Maule has made it his mission to do aught he can to honor his sireâ€™s legacy. His appointment as the new Ramsay lairdâ€™s second is a dream come true, but Lily Ramsayâ€™s beauty and irrepressible spirit threaten to make Kyle forget himself and fumble on the job. Desperate to do his duty to his laird and his fallen sire, Kyle tries to quell his feelings for Lilyâ€”to protect her without succumbing to the desire to be with her. But Lily is not the sort of lass to be held at armâ€™s length. When an unexpected threat befalls her, Kyle will have to decide to either let her in all the way or step away from her forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFile size: epub 294 Kb mobi 381 Kb\r\nPublisher: Keira Montclair (April 1, 2016)\r\nPublication Date: April 1, 2016\r\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f11564707d8def110aa78320974c3cee100a151","amp;dn":"Lily+Keira+Montclair+epub+mobi+The+Highland+Clan+Book+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f11564707d8def110aa78320974c3cee100a151","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,17,86,71,7,216,222,241,16,170,120,50,9,116,195,206,225,0,161,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
