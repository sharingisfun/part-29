Surrounded by friends and family the group finally got to perform songs from their landmark album, Diorama as well as a selection of earlier works. \n\nTickets for this unusually intimate show had sold out in less than ten minutes and could not be bought at any price. \n\nAs with all dates on this special tour, Silverchair staged the concert over two separate acts. The first set showcased mainly quieter and more experimental material while the second consisted mostly of the heavier rock songs on which the band had built their reputation as an incendiary live act. \n\nFor over two hours that night Silverchair created a rare and memorable musical experience live onstage. The four discs (2 CDs and 2 DVDs) that are contained in this package are the next best thing to actually being there. \n\nThis boxset was released only in Australia and New Zealand in the standard PAL format, with a limited number of NTSC sets also made available through the band&amp;#039;s official online store. \n\nIn 2007, Live from Faraway Stables was rereleased in separate double CD and double DVD formats. \n\nReleased November 10, 2003 \nRecorded April 19, 2003 \nGenre Rock, alternative, pop \nLength 133:05 \n\n\nAct I \n\n1. &quot;Overture&quot; \n2. &quot;After All These Years&quot; (Diorama) \n3. &quot;World Upon Your Shoulders&quot; (Diorama) \n4. &quot;Tuna In The Brine&quot; (Diorama) \n5. &quot;Luv Your Life&quot; (Diorama) \n6. &quot;Paint Pastel Princess&quot; (Neon Ballroom) \n7. &quot;Petrol &amp; Chlorine&quot; (Freak Show) \n8. &quot;Across The Night&quot; (Diorama) \n9. &quot;Ana&amp;#039;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; (Neon Ballroom) \n10. &quot;Miss You Love&quot; (Neon Ballroom) \n11. &quot;Steam Will Rise&quot; (Neon Ballroom) \n\nAct II \n\n1. &quot;Overture&quot; \n2. &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot; (Neon Ballroom) \n3. &quot;Without You&quot; (Diorama) \n4. &quot;Israel&amp;#039;s Son&quot; (Frogstomp) \n5. &quot;Black Tangled Heart&quot; (Neon Ballroom) \n6. &quot;Do You Feel The Same?&quot; (Neon Ballroom) \n7. &quot;The Greatest View&quot; (Diorama) \n8. &quot;The Door&quot; (Freak Show) \n9. &quot;Freak&quot; (Freak Show) \n10. &quot;Anthem for the Year 2000&quot; (Neon Ballroom) \n11. &quot;One Way Mule&quot; (Diorama) \n12. &quot;Asylum&quot; \n13. &quot;The Lever&quot; (Diorama)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2010a5c3552dd405901780d80de9f1d0931eded","amp;dn":"Silverchair+-+Live+from+Faraway+Stables+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2010a5c3552dd405901780d80de9f1d0931eded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,1,10,92,53,82,221,64,89,1,120,13,128,222,159,29,9,49,237,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
