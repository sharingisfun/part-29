She used to dread the empty feelings, but now she depends on them -- being invisible is better than having to answer the questions, better than having to deal with the pain. \nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so numb that she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even care that her relationship with her father is now nonexistent, or that she only has one real friend left in the world. She has a system, one that works, and one that keeps her emotionally shut off. \nBut the appearance of Nathan Daley threatens to ruin VictoriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carefully constructed world.\nNathan is arrogant, and a know-it-all, and so smart it makes Victoria sick. Not to mention heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absolutely beautiful. But the worst part? HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her new stepbrother. A stepbrother she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want, who came with a stepmother she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want. But before Victoria realizes it, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playing a dangerous game with Nathan. One thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexy, addicting, and forbidden -- but most of all, one that makes her feel alive again. Can Victoria come out of NathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game a better person? Or will it destroy her once and for all? Find out in Against All Odds by Kels Barnholdt. \nimage\n\nBefore The Storm (Against All Odds #2) by Kels Barnholdt \nFor the first time since her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, Victoria has something she cares about. Nathan is smart, funny, and totally gorgeous. Oh, and he also happens to be her future stepbrother. It was a shaky at first, but Victoria finally has Nathan right where she wants him, and for the first time in a long time she feels alive. But just when the dust begins to settle, VictoriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life takes a turn for the worse.\nVictoriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father finds out about Victoria and NathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship and takes matters into his own hands. The consequences to his actions are devastating, tragic, and unimaginable. Can Victoria somehow put her life back together, and most importantly, is there any hope for her and Nathan? The twists and turns are just getting started in the much-anticipated sequel to Against All Odds, Before the Storm.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9beeb802b8b9c83428f649cabd3ff0695ec6ee4c","amp;dn":"Against+All+Odds+Series+1-2+by+Kels+Barnholdt+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9beeb802b8b9c83428f649cabd3ff0695ec6ee4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,238,184,2,184,185,200,52,40,246,73,202,189,63,240,105,94,198,238,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
