The songs were gathered from their various studio releases, and are different bit rates. They should be playing a similar set throughout the entire tour. I even made a custom album art which matches their Brother album.\n\nThe songs are not a live recording from the show.\n\n1.  Thickfreakness \n2.  Girl Is On My Mind \n3.  The Breaks \n4.  Stack Shot Billy \n5.  Busted \n6.  Act Nice and Gentle \n7.  Everlasting Light \n8.  Next Girl \n9.  Chop and Change \n10. Howlin' For You \n11. Tighten Up \n12. She's Long Gone \n13. Ten Cent Pistol \n14. I'll Be Your Man \n15. Strange Times \n16. I Got Mine \n\nEncore:\n17. Sinister Kid \n18. Your Touch\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9422972d7f70cff6d70fff1d8afd1491f78c47ca","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys%3A+Summer+2011+Tour+Setlist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9422972d7f70cff6d70fff1d8afd1491f78c47ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,34,151,45,127,112,207,246,215,15,255,29,138,253,20,145,247,140,71,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
