Even I want to be Cary Grant.&quot;-Cary Grant\n \nHe is Hollywood's most fascinating and timeless star. Although he came to personify the debonair American, Cary Grant was born Archibald Leach on January 18, 1904, in the seaport village of Bristol, England. Combining the beauty of silent-screen legend Rudolph Valentino with the irresistibility of Clark Gable, Grant emerged as Hollywood's quintessential leading man. Yet beneath this idealized movie image was a conflicted man struggling to balance fame with a desire for an intensely private life separate from the &quot;Cary Grant&quot; persona celebrated by directors and movie studios.\n\nExploring Grant's troubled childhood, ambiguous sexuality, and lifelong insecurities as well as the magical amalgam of characteristics that allowed him to remain Hollywood's favorite romantic lead for more than thirty-five years, Cary Grant is the definitive examination of every aspect of Grant's professional and private life. \n\nApprox. 15-1/2 hours from 13 compact discs at 128 kbps in MP3 format.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f3d0b23b9e6bb1cb80060686920ee21d517fce","amp;dn":"Marc+Eliot+-+Cary+Grant+-+Biography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f3d0b23b9e6bb1cb80060686920ee21d517fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,243,208,178,59,158,107,177,203,128,6,6,134,146,14,226,29,81,127,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
