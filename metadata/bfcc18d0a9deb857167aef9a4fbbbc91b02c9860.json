The first single released from the album, &quot;More Than a Memory&quot;, made US country chart history the week of September 15, 2007, when it debuted at #1, the first to do so. The other new singles are &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; (written by Brooks, Jerrod Niemann, and Richie Brown), and &quot;Workin' for a Livin'&quot; which peaked in the Top 20. A non-single, &quot;Leave a Light On&quot; (Randy Goodrum and Tommy Sims), is also on this album.  The album was also released in a special pink edition on October 15, 2007, with proceeds going to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.  The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling about 352,000 copies in its first week.[2] Selling 204,000 copies, the album went to number one on the Top Country Albums chart in its second week.[3] In its third week, The Ultimate Hits sold 192,000 bringing its three week total to more than 748,000 albums sold.[4] In Great Britain the album was also a hit, reaching #1 in the Country music charts and the top 10 on the pop charts.  On January 18, 2008, the RIAA certified The Ultimate Hits Gold, Platinum &amp; 5Ãƒâ€” Multi-platinum - denoting shipments of 2.5 million in the United States.\n\t\nAll Music - Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine  -  In a way, it's like Garth Brooks never retired. He may have stopped touring and releasing new music, but he kept repackaging and reissuing his older albums, striking up an exclusive deal with Wal-Mart highlighted by a second box set called The Limited Series in 2006. That exclusivity contract expired in the summer of 2007, leaving Brooks a free agent, and he capitalized on his freedom almost immediately, delivering the double-disc singles collection The Ultimate Hits just in time for the holiday season of 2007. Where previous Garth repackagings could seem a little unnecessary -- it's not quite clear just how many of his fans needed that second Limited Series anyway -- The Ultimate Hits actually fills in a needed gap within his catalog, as Brooks hasn't had a hit compilation since his first, the 1994 The Hits. That disc was a &quot;limited edition&quot; at least in theory -- there were so many copies pressed it wasn't exactly rare -- and out of print since the mid-'90s, so it wasn't available in most retail stores, plus it didn't cover all the hits he had between its release and his retirement. The Ultimate Hits does exactly that, containing all 18 tracks from The Hits (albeit not in the same sequencing), adding 12 hits that he had in the last half of the '90s, along with four new songs highlighted by a cover of Huey Lewis &amp; the News' &quot;Workin' for a Livin'.&quot; The new songs are a nice touch, but the real purpose of this set is to offer casual fans a way to get all of Brooks' best-known hits in one package, and in that regard The Ultimate Hits not only succeeds, it's long overdue..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Ain't Going Down (Til The Sun Comes Up)\n[02] Friends In Low Places\n[03] Shameless\n[04] Two Of A Kind, Workin' On A Full House\n[05] The Beaches Of Cheyenne\n[06] If Tomorrow Never Comes\n[07] Papa Loved Mama\n[08] More Than A Memory\n[09] Good Ride Cowboy\n[10] In Another's Eyes - - - Garth Brooks With Trisha Yearwood\n[11] The Fever\n[12] Midnight Sun\n[13] Learning To Live Again\n[14] Longneck Bottle - - - Garth Brooks With Steve Wariner\n[15] To Make You Feel My Love\t\n[16] We Shall Be Free\n[17] The Dance\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:01m:08s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Callin' Baton Rouge\n[02] Two PiÃƒÂ±a Coladas\n[03] The Thunder Rolls\n[04] That Summer\n[05] The River\n[06] Beer Run - - - Garth Brooks With George Jones\n[07] Unanswered Prayers\n[08] Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\n[09] Workin' For A Livin' - - - Garth Brooks Duet With Huey Lewis\n[10] What She's Doing Now\n[11] When You Come Back To Me Again (From The Movie Frequency)\n[12] Standing Outside The Fire\n[13] American Honky-Tonk Bar Association\n[14] The Change\n[15] Rodeo\n[16] Wrapped Up In You\n[17] Leave A Light On\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:03m:12s\n\nDVD TRACK LISTING\n\n[01] Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\n[02] If Tomorrow Never Comes\n[03] The Dance\n[04] Friends In Low Places\n[05] Unanswered Prayers\n[06] Two Of A Kind, Workin' On A Full House\n[07] Thunder Rolls\n[08] Rodeo\n[09] Shameless\n[10] Papa Loved Mama\n[11] What She's Doing Now\n[12] River\n[13] We Shall Be Free\n[14] Learning To Live Again\n[15] That Summer\n[16] Standing Outside The Fire\n[17] Ain't Gonng Down ('Til The Sun Comes Up)\n[18] Calling Baton Rouge\n[19] American Honky-Tonk Bar Association\n[20] The Fever\n[21] To Make You Feel My Love\n[22] The Beaches Of Cheyenne\n[23] The Change\n[24] Two Pina Coladoas\n[25] Longneck Bottle (With Special Guest Stevie Wonder)\n[26] In Another's Eyes (Duet With Trisha Yearwood\n[27] Wrapped Up In You\n[28] Beer Run (Duet With George Jones)\n[29] When You Come Back To Me Again (From Frequency OST)\n[30] Good Ride Cowboy\n[31] More Than A Memory\n[32] Workin' For A Livin' (Duet With Huey Lewis)\n[33] Midnight Sun\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 02h:04m:21s\nTotal File Size....................... 7.82GBs (Including DVD, FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
