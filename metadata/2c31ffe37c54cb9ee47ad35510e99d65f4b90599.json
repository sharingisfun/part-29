The Theory proposes that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually lose it, but rather, their work simply advances beyond our comprehension. The ramifications and departures of this argument are limitless, and so are the examples worth considering, such as George LucasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jar Jar Binks, Stanley KubrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fascination with coffee commercials, and the last few decades of Paul McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. With equal doses of humor and philosophy, theorist Jason Hartley examines music, literature, sports, politics, and the very meaning of taste, presenting an entirely new way to appreciate the pop culture we love . . . and sometimes think we hate. The Advanced Genius Theory is a manifesto that takes on the least understood work by the most celebrated figures of our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c31ffe37c54cb9ee47ad35510e99d65f4b90599","amp;dn":"The+Advanced+Genius+Theory%3A+Are+They+Out+of+Their+Minds+or+Ahead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c31ffe37c54cb9ee47ad35510e99d65f4b90599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,49,255,227,124,84,203,158,228,122,211,85,16,233,157,101,244,185,5,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
