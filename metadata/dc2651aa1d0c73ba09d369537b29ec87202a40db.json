Last Call At Jimmy Ryan's [Alternate Take] [5:04]\n\nOne of the most exciting trumpeters to emerge during the swing era, Roy Eldridge's combative approach, chance-taking style and strong musicianship were an inspiration (and an influence) to the next musical generation, most notably Dizzy Gillespie. Although he sometimes pushed himself farther than he could go, Eldridge never played a dull solo.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Roy Eldridge had a regular gig at Jimmy Ryan's in New York playing music that fell between swing and Dixieland. For this Pablo LP, he sought to play a program with his regular group (Joe Muranyi on clarinet and soprano, trombonist Bobby Pratt, pianist Dick Katz, bassist Major Holley and drummer Eddie Locke) that, although recorded in the studio, would sound like one of the Jimmy Ryan sets. So, in addition to such standards as &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot; and &quot;All of Me,&quot; Eldridge also performs (and takes occasional vocals on) some older tunes like &quot;St. James Infirmary,&quot; &quot;Beale Street Blues&quot; and &quot;Bourbon Street Parade.&quot; The music is quite joyful and spirited, with Eldridge in exuberant form. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc2651aa1d0c73ba09d369537b29ec87202a40db","amp;dn":"Roy+Eldridge+Little+Jazz+and+The+Jimmy+Ryan+All+Stars%28jazz%29%28mp3%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc2651aa1d0c73ba09d369537b29ec87202a40db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,38,81,170,29,12,115,186,9,211,105,83,123,41,236,135,32,42,64,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
