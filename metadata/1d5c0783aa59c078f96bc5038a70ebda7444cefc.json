Only a priceless Mycenaean death mask has been taken, along with the bones of a legendary hero thought to exist only in ancient myth. Looted by the Nazis, the treasures are still being sought by those whose dreams of glory remain undefeated.\n\nThe mask is an unparalleled discovery that will be a force for devastating retribution in the wrong hands. But by the time museum curator Deborah Miller learns the truth, it may be too late not only to save herself but to reveal to the world the awesome secret she's uncovered.\n\n\nOn the Fifth Day\n\nThe death of a priest is met with suspicion by his brother Thomas, who knows that his sibling died while researching Christian symbols. But Thomas and curator Deborah Miller aren't alone in retracing the priest's final steps. They're followed by fanatics desperate to hide the secret stumbled upon by Thomas's brother-and willing to kill to keep it buried forever.\n\n\nWhat Time Devours\n\nA dead woman. A literary treasure. A dangerous quest.\n\nThomas Knight, the protagonist from On the Fifth Day, returns and is faced with a centuries-old mystery surrounding a long-lostÃ¢â‚¬â€and now pricelessÃ¢â‚¬â€Shakespearean play. To find it, Thomas will have to enter a story which drags loss and death after it like one of ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragedies, a story bound to time and all it devours.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5c0783aa59c078f96bc5038a70ebda7444cefc","amp;dn":"A.+J.+Hartley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d5c0783aa59c078f96bc5038a70ebda7444cefc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,92,7,131,170,89,192,120,249,107,197,3,138,112,235,218,116,68,206,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
