This edition takes a two-path approach to the topics; design techniques are developed for both long- and short-channel CMOS technologies and then compared. The results are multidimensional explanations that allow readers deep insight into the design process.\nFeatures include:\n\n* Integrated-circuit layout software for Windows designed by David Boyce\n* Updated materials to reflect CMOS technology's movement into nanometer sizes\n* Discussions on phase- and delay-locked loops, mixed-signal circuits, data converters, and circuit noise\n* More than 1,000 figures, 200 examples, and over 500 end-of-chapter problems\n* In-depth coverage of both analog and digital circuit-level design techniques\n* Real-world process parameters and design rules\n* Associated Web site (cmosedu.com) provides examples, solutions, and SPICE simulation netlists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed45234fd74a1a2c1e0a4462da3621e793de135b","amp;dn":"CMOS+Circuit+Design%2C+Layout%2C+and+Simulation%2C+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed45234fd74a1a2c1e0a4462da3621e793de135b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,69,35,79,215,74,26,44,30,10,68,98,218,54,33,231,147,222,19,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
