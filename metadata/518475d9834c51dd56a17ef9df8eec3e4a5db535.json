Forward Operating Base (FOB) in the Gulistan district of Afghanistan is nothing but an exposed sandpitÃ¢â‚¬â€scorched by inescapable sunlight and deadly mortar fire.\n\nEach member in the platoon manages the toxic mix of boredom and fear that is life at the FOB in his own way. Brash Cederna shamelessly picks on the virgin Ietri. Giulia Zampieri seemingly navigates this male-dominated world with easeÃ¢â‚¬â€until two male comrades start vying for her attention. And for medical officer Alessandro Egitto, the FOB serves as an escape from a real life even more dangerous than one fought with guns. At night, lying on their beds, they feel the beat of their own hearts, the ceaseless activity of the human body. But when a much-debated mission goes devastatingly awry, the soldiers find their lives changed in an instant","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:518475d9834c51dd56a17ef9df8eec3e4a5db535","amp;dn":"The+Human+Body+by+Paolo+Giordano+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"518475d9834c51dd56a17ef9df8eec3e4a5db535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,132,117,217,131,76,81,221,86,161,126,249,223,142,236,62,74,93,181,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
