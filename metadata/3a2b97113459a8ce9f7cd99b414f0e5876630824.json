Wouldnt surprise me if ALL the cds in their collection was from 1966-69 either. A good thing if you ask me ^_^\n\n\nBaby Woodrose is Lorenzo, drummer from Danish heavy stoner/psych rockers, On Trial. Here, he plays all the instruments (guitars, drums, organ &amp; electric piano), performing songs very much in the retro-garage blazing fuzz-psych tradition, more 1966 than either later-60s acid rock psychedelia, or the 70s heavy rock that inspired today's &quot;stoner&quot; scene. The influences of that era are abundant and pretty readily apparent, referencing everything from the Thirteenth Floor Elevators to the Strawberry Alarm Clock, by way of the Yardbirds, Electric Prunes, Seeds, Chocolate Watchband; even the Stooges and Sonics. The guitars are either twangy &amp; reverb-drenched or maximally fuzzed, the vocals snarl in your face or ooze from the murk deep in the back of the reverb chamber; all of the expected period nuances are there. Not much in the way of &quot;space&quot; (nice seagull screams on &quot;Living A Dream&quot;, though) or &quot;progressive&quot; (it's far too greasy) music here, but fans of earlier &quot;head&quot; music ought to get into this album. After all, how can you argue with a song like &quot;Right To Get High&quot;?\n\n\n\n192kbs\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. No Way Out\n2. Baby Blows Your Mind\n3. What A Burn!\n4. Caught In A Whirl\n5.
