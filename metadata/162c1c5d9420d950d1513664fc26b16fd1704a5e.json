Why can men be so distant in bed? Why do many men love porn so much? And can he love porn and still love his wife? Respected psychologist Michael Bader takes an honest look at the nuances of male sexuality, addressing issues such as sexual boredom, internet sex, and sexual fantasies that can leave women bewildered and men ashamed. Illustrated with engaging examples from his practice, Male Sexuality gives readers, both women and men, deeper understanding of male behavior from the flamboyant to the mundane. Through increased awareness of the psychology behind the sex, Bader aims to enhance individual self-esteem and improve communication in relationships.\n\nRowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers\n2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162c1c5d9420d950d1513664fc26b16fd1704a5e","amp;dn":"Male+Sexuality%3A+Why+Women+Don%5C%27t+Understand+It-And+Men+Don%5C%27t+Ei","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162c1c5d9420d950d1513664fc26b16fd1704a5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,44,28,93,148,32,217,80,209,81,54,100,252,38,177,111,209,112,74,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
