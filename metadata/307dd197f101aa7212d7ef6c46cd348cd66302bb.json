This release has all the original members except for Keith Wyatt replacing Dave Alvin on guitar. The Blasters have included more blues on this release than any of their other previous releases, and still get some rockabilly, country, bluegrass and even mariachi songs in the mix. Phil Alvin sings a duet with Exene Cervenka on the Johnny and June Cash classic Jackson.
