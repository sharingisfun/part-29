Carlos recorded only one single with the group, leaving to pursue a solo career and to perform with a band, Don Carlos and Gold. Sixteen years later he returned and joined with Dennis and Simpson to resurrect the original trio. Their first album together, Now, released in 1990, helped Black Uhuru to recapture the popularity they enjoyed in the 1970s and '80s, though Carlos' involvement with the trio was brief. Shortly after helping Dennis and Simpson to record a second trio album, Iron Storm, Carlos resumed his solo career. While he's recorded some impressive albums, including his 1997 solo outing, Seven Days a Week, Carlos has yet to match the success he had with Black Uhuru. ~ Craig Harris, All Music Guide\n\n\nEnjoyyy and Seed .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ce6cf623774cb3f0612bf0f0b06995608371bba","amp;dn":"Don+Carlos+-+Groove+With+Me+%28+flac+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ce6cf623774cb3f0612bf0f0b06995608371bba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,230,207,98,55,116,203,63,6,18,191,15,11,6,153,86,8,55,27,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
