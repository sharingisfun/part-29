It  \nseems  as  if  every time  I  get  past  one  obstacle, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m  \nright  back  in  the  mist  of  another. I  guess  you  \ncould  say  that  I  was  just  another  youngster  on  a  \nmission  striving  to  find  his  place  in  this  cruel  \nworld. \n          \nDuring  the  mist  of  my  quest  I  was  \nintroduced  to  so  much  negativity, that  eventually, I  \nwas  pushed  in  the  vicious  hands  of  BabylonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  \nmodern  day  servants. Within  hours  I  went  from  \nhearing  the  constant  irritable  sounds  of  gun  shots  \nand  sirens  to  hearing  these  steel  doors  open  and  \nclose  every  hour  or  so. But  on  this  cold  day  in  \nFebruary, all  that  has  had  my  full  attention  will  be  \ncompletely  out  of  my  sight.
