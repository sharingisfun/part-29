It was the last album to contain the talents of the late guitarist Criss Oliva. It is also the first Savatage album to feature Zachary Stevens on Lead Vocals, following the departure of Jon Oliva from the fore of the band.\n\nThe drums on this album sound different from other Savatage records as on this album Steve decided to use electronic drums. Although most of the drum kits sounds authentic, you can hear the difference in the toms.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02e4f72c93cc22c84cf571f7e03e96e94a7ec1d4","amp;dn":"Savatage++Edge+of+thorns-1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02e4f72c93cc22c84cf571f7e03e96e94a7ec1d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,228,247,44,147,204,34,200,76,245,113,247,224,62,150,233,74,126,193,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
