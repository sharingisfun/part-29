Boasting an even stronger and wider-ranging set of songs, Other Voices, Too (A Trip Back to Bountiful) captures the singer at her most radiant and expressive -- moving easily from the Stephen Foster perennial &quot;Hard Times Come Again No More&quot; to '60s pop hits like &quot;You Were on My Mind&quot; to British folk-rock chestnuts like Richard Thompson's &quot;Wall of Death&quot; and Sandy Denny's &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot; -- Griffith stamps each of these 19 tracks with her own indelible signature, revitalizing not only her material but herself in the process.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cbb6bd87173a19cb2ccedcc7eec58bcb0e5971e","amp;dn":"Nanci+Griffith+-+Other+Voices%2C+Too+%28A+Trip+Back+To+Bountiful%29+%5B1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cbb6bd87173a19cb2ccedcc7eec58bcb0e5971e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,187,107,216,113,115,161,156,178,204,237,204,126,236,88,188,176,229,151,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
