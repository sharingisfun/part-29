The Experience of Ancient Egypt provides an engaging portrait of what we know about ancient Egypt today, examining issues of religion, beliefs and practices surrounding death, everyday life, and literature. David then looks at the history of Egyptology itself--tracing the discipline from its classical roots, through the deciphering of hieroglyphs in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the most up-to-date biomedical and archaeological techniques.\n\nThis book provides a comprehensive portrait of what we know about ancient Egypt today, examining in detail issues of religion, of beliefs and practices surrounding death, of everyday life and of literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a33791172c63b797db6084248f4a193311d79478","amp;dn":"The+Experience+of+Ancient+Egypt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a33791172c63b797db6084248f4a193311d79478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,55,145,23,44,99,183,151,219,96,132,36,143,74,25,51,17,215,148,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
