Do enjoy.\n\n------------------------------------------\nThis release contains ALL of the DVD Extras!  \n------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nStarring PAUL McGANN and SHERIDAN SMITH\n\nGuest starring MICHAEL MALONEY and CHRISTOPHER BENJAMIN\nWith KATARINA OLSSON as THE HEADHUNTER and LOUISE FULLERTON as KAREN\n\n\nTechnical Details\nCast: Paul McGann (The Doctor); Sheridan Smith (Lucie Miller); Michael Maloney (Simonsson); Christopher Benjamin (Tardelli); Colin Spaull (Henrik); Sebastian Armesto (Anders); Katarina Olsson (The Headhunter); Louise Fullerton (Karen)\nWriter: Eddie Robson Recorded: -\nDirector: Barnaby Edwards Released: May 2008\nMusic: ERS No. of Discs: 1\nSound Design: ERS Duration 60&amp;#039; Approx\nCover Illustration: Grant Kempster Production Code: BFPDWCDMG013\nISBN: 978-1-84435-306-4\n\nSynopsis\nHere&amp;#039;s to crime, Doctor!\n\nThe Doctor and Lucie visit nineteenth-century Sweden and become embroiled in an attempt to steal the infamous Black Diamond.\n\nBut the stone is guarded by forces not of this world...\n\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\n\n(I no longer support the MP3 or CD formats as they are a waste of time and cause confusion.)\n\nWith a single M4B file you can play it free with Apple Itunes, Quicktime (on your PC!) and of course on an iPod. There is no longer any reason for some huge amount of small MP3 files to go together. This is a single file and everything I release in the future will be a single file. So long to MP3 (and a belated SO LONG to CD format, what a pain in the ass!) hehehe\n\nThe nice thing about this iPod format is that not only do you not have to have an iPod to listen, iTunes and Quicktime keep track of your position in listening to the story for you. It bookmarks your location. So there is no longer any need to remember what &quot;CD Track&quot; you were on.\n\nThis release contains ALL of the DVD Extras!  \n\nEnjoy!
