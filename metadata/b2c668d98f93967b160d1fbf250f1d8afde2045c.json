We tend to take today's modern United Kingdom for granted, but there was nothing inevitable about its creation. During the 17th century, the Stuarts grappled with the chaos of three separate kingdoms, multiple religions and civil war. Britain has not known a century like it and some of the questions this dynasty faced have not gone away.\r\n\r\n1)  And I Will Make Them One Nation \r\nClare Jackson looks at James VI and I's attempts to unite Scotland and England under the umbrella of his crown and persuade his subjects to feel more 'British'.\r\n\r\n2)  A King Without a Crown \r\nAfter Charles I's disastrous attempt to militarily impose political and religious uniformity throughout his kingdoms, both the Stuart dynasty and its three kingdoms fell into an abyss. Charles lost his head and his family fled into exile. She reveals how the unprecedented religious violence of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms shaped the very DNA of British political culture and how the trauma suffered shaped subsequent constitutional crises in the years to come.\r\n\r\n3)  A Family at War \r\nThe final, dramatic act of the Stuart century saw the Stuarts fatally divided by religion: brother versus brother, and two daughters supporting the overthrow of their father. After Charles II's brother, the Catholic James VII and II, was deposed by protestant William of Orange in 1688, Britain became a constitutional monarchy. However, the so-called 1688 'Glorious Revolution' came at a price, as Scotland lost her sovereignty and became part of Great Britain in 1707, whilst Ireland had been reduced from a kingdom to a colony. The politics of resentment has continued to trouble Ireland until the present day.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/The-Stuarts-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8a/The-Stuarts-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/The-Stuarts-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/The-Stuarts-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/The-Stuarts-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/The-Stuarts-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/The-Stuarts-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/The-Stuarts-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/The-Stuarts-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/The-Stuarts-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/The-Stuarts-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/The-Stuarts-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 22 (~3774Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 3\r\n * Part Size: 1.64 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01lkn5l","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c668d98f93967b160d1fbf250f1d8afde2045c","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Stuarts+2of3+A+King+Without+A+Crown+1080p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c668d98f93967b160d1fbf250f1d8afde2045c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,198,104,217,143,147,150,123,22,13,31,191,37,15,29,138,253,226,4,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
