His success places the Crown Prince at Queen Minna-Satu's mercy, and Blade becomes the instrument of her wrath. Forged in the fires of fury, his heart died long ago in the desert kingdom. His glance is as icy as his smile is disarming, and the fires of passion will never stir his blood. He is the Master of the Dance in Jondar, the best to ever hold the title. Driven by hatred and with the skills of his trade, he will usher in a time of strife and pain that will live in legend, and forever bear his name. He is the instrument who can change fate. He is the Queen's Blade.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe498a9b25d934ca47020b4192a0e96f8b404a03","amp;dn":"The+Queen%27s+Blade%3A+Book+One+of+the+Queen%27s+Blade+Series+by+T.+So","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe498a9b25d934ca47020b4192a0e96f8b404a03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,73,138,155,37,217,52,202,71,2,11,65,146,160,233,111,139,64,74,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
