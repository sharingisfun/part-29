It doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t matter if you call yourself a Christian or an agnostic; we all have the same adversary if the final goal of that person is to do great harm (death) unto you. The adversary uses some of yours and my favorite things to subliminally (a synonym of the word subtle) advertise beliefs to us. \n\nI will show you marketing techniques that use sex and/or theologies to sell you. Whether it is subtle displacement, product placement, or theology placement they (the marketers) are trying to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ you. The Bible makes it clear; you either serve God or the Devil. God declares you are a child of Light or a child of darkness, a sheep or a goat, and a wheat or a tare.\n\nMarketing is a part of every facet of our society. From the time a child is born, they are marketed. New age visualization, astral projection, and disgusting sex acts are placed in commercials, sitcoms, talk shows, and even in childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cartoons. If you can stomach the length of this film you will be stronger than most. Do not let the images you see in this film frighten youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦unless you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know the Lord.\n\nThis download includes Brain-O II Plunger Included Introduction and Sections 1-3 of 7 of my dvd movie.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA brief overview of what a subliminal message is and the beginnings of subliminal advertising.\nSubliminal. Not many words catch the attention of people like this word. Ironic to think that when the word is defined as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfunctioning below the threshold of concisenessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, (by Merriam-Webster.) It is a synonym for the word subtil. It isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t defined as backwards, hidden, eso or exoteric. In order for a subliminal message to effect the intended it must be seen even if unknowingly.\n\nSection 1: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Subtil Nature of SatanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYe shall be as godsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This is THE LIE of the Devil. It is the biggest subliminal message being conveyed today. I will show this is conveyed mostly to children. The molders of our society or the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpuppet mastersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ who run the world are not hidden from the commoner anymore. It is nearly common knowledge to everyone I know at least that a very small few are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin chargeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of this planet economically, and militarily. You might call them the military industrial complex, or you might call them the secret societies. I want to brief you, so to speak, on what a high up in the occult world of the secret society freemasonry and the most esteemed mason of the 20th century had to say in regards to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcoming ageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and how ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (the masons and other occult groups) plan on teaching children in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œright ways.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSection 2: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSex SellsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nSex sells some say. It is widely been a marketing standard for quite some time now. Just how and who markets sex? Well you can go back and scan all those images that just flashed for a brief moment or you can just stick around and see for yourself. Do you doubt for one instant that companies and remember that even a television show is made by a company, do you not think that they not only put product placement in tv, movies, ads, video games, and or anything you put before your eyes but they put in sexual innuendos to get you thinking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhappy thoughtsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½?\n\nSection 3: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWitchcraft and Nature WorshipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWhether you worship a stick or the half goat half man named pan, you can call yourself a witch. Is witchcraft the choice of acceptable religion in the public schooling system? It is my contention that it is the very choice of religion that is fully tolerated. Some professing Christians can be found supporting it at Harry Potter movies or on Halloween trick or treating. The Bible says my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge. Do you want knowledge? Do you want understanding? LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s start examining ourselves and the things put before our eyes. With this video we can use the very definition of witchcraft to expose some less discerned sources of it.\n\nSections 4-7 coming March 31 2012\n\nThis filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s goals are simple: to show the viewers that whether or not they believe that what they put before their eyes and ears can affect them; they do. I will use a barrage of TV shows ranging from childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cartoons to sitcoms, movies, commercials, magazines, ads, video games, and much more. It is impossible to not be influenced by a subliminal message. However, what is impossible with man is possible with God. \n\nWritten, all editing, music production and sound, graphic work, and direction all done under the guidance of the Holy Spirit by Justin Ludwig. If you know the Lord, I am your brother in Christ, and do this out of the kindness of my heart; to give glory to Whom it belongsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Jesus Christ.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nSubjects in these sections are: drop Dead Fred, The Labyrinth, Adventure Time, Conan, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Family Guy, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Dragon Ball Z, Smurfs, Ren &amp; Stimpy, Tom &amp; Jerry, Galaxy Rangers; Beavis &amp; Butthead, Sonic the Hedgehog, Simpsons, Daffy Duck and the Looney Toons, Bill &amp; Mandy, Freakazoid, Animaniacs, Carebears, Sailormoon, Jem &amp; The Holograms, Invader Zim, Duckman, Popeye, Power Puff Girls, The Adventures of Mark Twain, Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, V for Vendetta, The Watchmen, Batman, Superman, The Invisibles, Aleister Crowley, New World Order, Magic, Magick, Sex, Witchcraft, Desperate Housewives, The Homosexual Agenda in Public Schools, Sigil Magick, Hand Signs, Commercials, Michael Aquino, Psyop, MindWar, Ted Bundy, Blair Witch Project, Witches, Secret Circle, Witch Mountain, Enchanted, Manly P.
