First, the eggs roll slowly, but the pace of the game is accelerating gradually. Every 20 and 30 scored points the pace of the game slows down a bit.\r\nIn the case the egg falls, the player is given a penalty point, which is indicated by a chicken - it will appear on the box on your right. If it occurs in the presence of a kitten, which appears in the box on your left, then the player is given a half of the penalty point - on the box on your right appears an egg instead of the chicken","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a2b894e492a169c65f87131097d509e82918eb1","amp;dn":"Ceggtcher+VR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a2b894e492a169c65f87131097d509e82918eb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,43,137,78,73,42,22,156,101,248,113,49,9,125,80,158,130,145,142,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
