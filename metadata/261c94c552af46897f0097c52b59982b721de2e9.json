After high demand, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take that completed design and convert it into a standards-compliant HTML and CSS web page. Along the way, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll review a variety of nifty techniques that will help you to improve your own workflow.\nEven better, when we hit 80,000 RSS subscribers, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take things even further and convert the finished product into a custom WordPress theme.\nRather than overload you with a massive 4-5 part series all at once, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll post a new episode in this miniseries every day. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my hope that, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at the point in your career where you can benefit from a series like this, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll work along with me each lesson.\n\nMore info: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/site-builds/convert-a-warm-cheerful-web-design-to-html-and-css/\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261c94c552af46897f0097c52b59982b721de2e9","amp;dn":"NetTutsPlus+-+Convert+a+Warm%2C+Cheerful+Web+Design+to+HTML+and+CS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261c94c552af46897f0097c52b59982b721de2e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,28,148,197,82,175,70,137,127,0,151,197,43,89,152,43,114,29,226,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
