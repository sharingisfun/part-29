Out of four, here's the second one: The Grinch. I know, I should've uploaded it on Christmas, but I'm a lazy bastard, and it's up now, anyway. Ripped with MagicDisc, tested on ePSXe and it worked fine. If you like it, seed it, and if you've got something to say about the torrent, go ahead and leave a comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89bae3dd19949d9206ba80e5ba127b5cec5efa82","amp;dn":"%5BPSX%5D+The+Grinch+%5BPAL-NTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89bae3dd19949d9206ba80e5ba127b5cec5efa82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,186,227,221,25,148,157,146,6,186,128,229,186,18,123,92,236,94,250,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
