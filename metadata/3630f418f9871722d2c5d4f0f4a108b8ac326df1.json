If you are new to Traditional Irish Music, this is a good starter collection.\n\n40 Shades Of Green                                                         \nAnnie Laurie                                                               \nArthur McBride                                                             \nBallinasloe                                                                \nCarrickfergus                                                              \nCome Back To Erin                                                          \nFeilim's Little Boat Phelims (Baidin Fheidhlimi)                           \nFiddler's Green                                                            \nFlower Of Sweet Strabane                                                   \nGoodnight Irene                                                            \nIf You're Irish                                                            \nI'll Take You Home Again Kathleen                                          \nLimerick Is Beautiful                                                      \nLittle Fairy, Big Fairy                                                    \nLondonderry Air (Danny Boy)                                                \nMaggie                                                                     \nMolly Malone                                                               \nMorrison Merrily Kissed The Quaker                                         \nMy Wild Irish Rose                                                         \nPort Lairge                                                                \nRamblin Irishman                                                           \nRising Of The Moon                                                         \nRoscabury                                                                  \nRoving Galway Boy                                                          \nScarce O'Tatties                                                           \nSilver Threads Among Gold                                                  \nSleivenamon                                                                \nSport Of The Chase                                                         \nThe Beggarman                                                              \nthe Irish Rover                                                            \nThe Lark In The Clear Air                                                  \nThe Minstrel Boy                                                           \nThe Nightingale                                                            \nThe Rose Of Tralee                                                         \nThe Wild Colonial Boy                                                      \nThe Wild Rover                                                             \nThree Young Ladies Drinking Whiskey Before Breakfast                       \nWhiskey In The Jar                                                         \nWhistling Gypsy Rover                                                      \nWhite, Orange, And Green (Tabhair Dom Do Lamh)  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3630f418f9871722d2c5d4f0f4a108b8ac326df1","amp;dn":"Celtic+Love+Collection+-+Irish+Folk+Music+%5B4cd+Box+Set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3630f418f9871722d2c5d4f0f4a108b8ac326df1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,48,244,24,249,135,23,34,210,197,212,240,244,161,8,184,172,50,109,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
