It is loosely based on the 1990s Spider-Man: The Animated Series.\n\nThis game was made in 2000, and has nothing to do with Spiderman: the Movie: the Game.\n\nWhile attending a scientific demonstration hosted by Dr. Otto Octavius, Peter Parker (Spider-Man) witnesses the appearance of a Spider-Man impostor, who steals Doctor Octavius's experiment. Eddie Brock mistakes this for the real Spider-Man and tries to take pictures, but his camera is shattered by the Spider-Man impostor. Due to his failure and anger, Brock causes the Venom symbiote to surface, and then swears revenge. Everyone present at the demonstration believes that Spider-Man took the experiment, causing the police to begin a manhunt for Spider-Man. Meanwhile, two mysterious people unleash a fog upon the streets of New York ... and it's about as exciting as all that.\n\nImage format: bin/cue\nRegion: NTSC\nConfirmed to load on PS3 fw 3.55-kmeaw/multiman, because that's the best thing you can do with a PS3 :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bac64c33c42148c2c99b026892ae5e4afd94fa7","amp;dn":"Spiderman+Spider-Man+PS1+PSX+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bac64c33c42148c2c99b026892ae5e4afd94fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,172,100,195,60,66,20,140,44,153,176,38,137,42,229,228,175,217,79,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
