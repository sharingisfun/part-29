Over the next few months, both their lives are irrevocably altered by the events which follow Fred's arrival, events which are the trivial stuff of a comedy of manners at first but which gradually grow increasingly dramatic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eae6d0bb1865e0173a516f7f7192bbfd4329b3d","amp;dn":"Barcelona+%281994%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eae6d0bb1865e0173a516f7f7192bbfd4329b3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,174,109,11,177,134,94,1,115,165,22,247,247,25,43,191,212,50,155,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
