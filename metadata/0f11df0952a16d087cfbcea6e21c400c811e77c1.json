Then Dirk stumbles upon an old friend behaving bizarrely, and he is drawn into a four-billion year old mystery that must be solved if the human race is to avoid immediate extinction.\n\nFeaturing a star-studded cast with Harry Enfield in the lead role, Dirk Gently&amp;#039;s Holistic Detective Agency will be produced by the same award-winning team that made the conclusion to The Hitchhiker&amp;#039;s Guide To The Galaxy. Harry is joined by Lord of the Rings actor Billy Boyd, Fawlty Towers&amp;#039; Andrew Sachs, The Golden Compass&amp;#039; Jim Carter and Peepshow&amp;#039;s Olivia Colman.\n\nConsidered by many Adams fans to be as funny as, if darker than, Hitchhikers, the Dirk Gently novels reflect Douglas&amp;#039; unique and funny take on matters as wide-ranging as consciousness, conservation, man&amp;#039;s place in the cosmos and crime. The first series features everything from quantum physics to missing cats, via Coleridge, Bach and an Electric Monk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f11df0952a16d087cfbcea6e21c400c811e77c1","amp;dn":"Dirk+Gently%5C%27s+Holistic+Detective+Agency+Episode+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f11df0952a16d087cfbcea6e21c400c811e77c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,17,223,9,82,161,109,8,124,251,206,166,226,28,64,12,129,30,119,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
