The answer is that he was both, and he not only made some of the greatest Hank Williams-styled hillbilly and honky tonk music of the '50s, but some of the finest rockabilly as well. Recorded between 1951 and 1958, the track line-up here includes 'Where The Rio De Rosa Flows', 'The Death Of Hank Williams', 'Midnight Boogie', 'These Lonesome Blues', 'It's All Over But The Shouting' and 24 others from Decca, Roulette, and Dot Records, as well as Jimmie's incredibly rare first record on Harvest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:547a39cd04d08e00ab5bca282cec2449d72ab541","amp;dn":"Jimmie+Logsdon+-+I+Got+A+Rocket+In+My+Pocket+-+Bear+Family+CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"547a39cd04d08e00ab5bca282cec2449d72ab541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,122,57,205,4,208,142,0,171,91,202,40,44,236,36,73,215,42,181,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
