I'm From Cali\n2. I Want You\n3. So Complicated\n4. All I Need\n5. Satisfied\n6. Gonna Get Together\n7. Peace of Mind\n8. All We Need Is Love\n9. I'm Alive\n10. Bluebird\n11. Oh So Bad\n12. Something About You\n\nNotes:\nThis album will most likely be found by people searching for &quot;Gonna Get Together&quot; which is why I decided to include it in the title. I heard that song of course and loved it, so with the way I am I must have the whole album and seeing how no torrent existed (that I found) I bought it off iTunes JUST FOR YOUU!! ;)\n\nOf course I ran it through an mp3 converter in order to remove the permissions and shit so you can play it on your own iTunes. Please enjoy \n\nOnce again my computer does not allow me to change properties so it may be unorganized in Windows explorer, but should fix itself in iTunes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c787d2f89bff37ce818352b64da41c1fedea5a8","amp;dn":"Leroy+-+Squish+%28Gonna+Get+Together%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c787d2f89bff37ce818352b64da41c1fedea5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,120,125,47,137,191,243,124,232,24,53,43,100,218,65,193,254,222,165,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
