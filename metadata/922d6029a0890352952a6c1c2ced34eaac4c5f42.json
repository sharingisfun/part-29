There they are happy to experiment with creating flavourful healthy food and with a wine in hand they can â€œsolve the worldâ€™s problemsâ€. The next step in their future is a wedding event company for Rosie, and a providore for Paige.\r\nHow did you meet?\r\nPaige: I went to a friendâ€™s house to do something and Rosie was there. You were on the couch. And I thought, â€œWhoâ€™s this interloper?â€ And she didnâ€™t even introduce herself or anything. She just sat there like a mute.\r\nRosie: It is pretty intimidating with that group of friends at times, being the interloper. I was the newbie.\r\nWho taught you to cook?\r\nPaige: My mum Wendy and my grandma Marybelle. Weâ€™re a big family of cooks so I grew up in the kitchen. Every memory I have as a kid is being in the kitchen. I love food; I love eating food. Itâ€™s all there in the back of my head; I just have to remember it.\r\nRosie: My best friend at the time was an apprentice chef. I sort of learnt a lot of base skills from her and then built on that myself.\r\nWhat does cooking mean to you?\r\nPaige: Rosie gets very romantic when she talks about cooking. I enjoy cooking for me, itâ€™s more entertaining friends and family and making a lovely meal for them rather than some crap out of the freezer. Itâ€™s nice to be able to do something and do it well. And sometimes itâ€™s one of those things you can do on autopilot and itâ€™s relaxing as well.\r\nRosie: I just love immersing myself in it. I like creating things and making something from nothing almost. Just from scratch, from base elements. Itâ€™s a bit of a creative outlet for me.\r\nHow do you be creative while cooking for a young family? \r\nPaige: Her kids eat gourmet.\r\nRosie: They eat what we eat. Beth likes pate and a cheese platter. They are pretty good eaters.\r\nDo your kids like cooking?\r\nRosie: I want them to learn but it drives me crazy at the same time because they get the chair and drag it across the kitchen floor and then say, â€œMummy can we helpâ€ and Iâ€™m like, â€œOf course you can.â€ Itâ€™s going to be 10 times more of a mess but Iâ€™m happy for them to do it. They need to learn to cook one day so she might as well start now.\r\nDo you have a particular style of cooking?\r\nRosie: We do both love Middle Eastern food and a lot of Asian food. Paige: Especially in winter weâ€™re both guilty of doing a lot of comfort, rustic foods.\r\nIs your strength in sweet or savoury?\r\nPaige: Weâ€™re definitely a lot stronger at savoury. I never really ate sweets growing up.\r\nRosie: We mightâ€™ve had a square of dark chocolate and a cube of apple every now and then.\r\nPaige: Itâ€™s almost like you were mistreated.\r\nRosie: Itâ€™s cool though because I love dark chocolate and itâ€™s good for you.\r\nWhat do you love most about each other?\r\nPaige: How passionate she gets about the most random things. It makes me giggle and itâ€™s very endearing. And the way that even though sheâ€™s thought about every single possible outcome to anything thatâ€™s ever happened, once push comes to shove she stills goes, â€œSh*t, what will I do?â€ Itâ€™s quite funny.\r\nRosie: Her hilarity. How you can be just in any situation and make me laugh. And you are generally freakinâ€™ hilarious.\r\nAre you competitive?\r\nPaige: I am. Itâ€™s from my sister and brother. We used to have this game where we would see who could eat the biggest whole piece of food at the table. Weâ€™d be swallowing half a boiled potato. Itâ€™s sibling rivalry thatâ€™s just grown.\r\nRosie: Iâ€™m not competitive. I hate sport. Itâ€™s just too much pressure being in a team and needing to win. Why canâ€™t everyone just be happy playing?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:922d6029a0890352952a6c1c2ced34eaac4c5f42","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.s07e04.WS.PDTV.x264.BF1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"922d6029a0890352952a6c1c2ced34eaac4c5f42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,45,96,41,160,137,3,82,149,42,108,28,44,237,52,234,172,76,95,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
