Since nobody photographs libraries as beautifully as Hofer, it seemed only natural to dedicate one of her publications to the splendid and intimate cathedrals of knowledge across Europe and the US: the Escorial in Spain, the Whitney Museum in New york, Villa Medici in Rome, the Hamburg University library, the Bibliotheque nationale de France in Paris, the Museo Archeologico in Madrid, and Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, to name just a few. \n\nAlmost completely devoid of people, as is Candida Hofer's trademark, these pictures radiate a comforting serenity that is exceptional in contemporary photography. Now available in an unchanged reprint.\n\nPS. Average scan, but I edited a little ... crop, de-skew, noise etc everything that can be done in 3 hours, Size fel from 668 MB to acceptable 159...enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d49e8b2b7abed09c0e040cb504b4d338c0bcefa3","amp;dn":"Libraries+%28Art+Photo+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d49e8b2b7abed09c0e040cb504b4d338c0bcefa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,158,139,43,122,190,208,156,14,4,12,181,4,180,211,56,192,188,239,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
