Silvertrust notes that Stenhammar's six string quartets are the most important written between those of Brahms and BartÃƒÂ³k. Whether or not this is so, there is no denying that Stenhammar's quartets represent a very important development during the twenty-five years he was writing chamber music. Tonally, they range from the middle late Romantics to a style akin to mature Sibelius. Though not unknown by the Swedish chamber music public, his string quartets have been sadly neglected elsewhere.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI'm trying to generate some communal sharing of the serious music repertoire beyond the &quot;Mozart's Greatest Hits&quot; level, but nowhere appears to have taken over the mantle of the old demonoid of two years ago.  I'm aware they are back at .ph but with very few seeded works and spotty availability to date.  Sadly, while I have the material, I lack access to a seed box so I am going to have to try to generate some active sharing/seeding.  Requests accepted, but be patient please as I have only a 1 mbps upload max.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7fad48e9b644c78c1c8b6cde5f8d2f20d887f4e","amp;dn":"Stenhammar+Complete+String+Quartets+-+Part+III","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7fad48e9b644c78c1c8b6cde5f8d2f20d887f4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,250,212,142,155,100,76,120,193,200,182,205,229,248,210,242,13,136,127,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
