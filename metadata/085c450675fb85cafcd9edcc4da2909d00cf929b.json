He does not accept that Pif, this fleabag, can delight stardom. He decides, therefore, on an impulse, to change his life and retire to a deserted island- or the nearest thing: to relate his career and write his own film. In a paradise-like setting, Hercule recounts the biggest roles of his career. Pif isn't absent from his memories, but Hercule still considers him to be a fifth wheel... However, this, in reality, is not exactly the case..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:085c450675fb85cafcd9edcc4da2909d00cf929b","amp;dn":"Les+mille+et+une+farces+de+Pif+et+Hercule+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"085c450675fb85cafcd9edcc4da2909d00cf929b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,92,69,6,117,251,133,202,252,217,237,204,77,162,144,157,0,207,146,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
