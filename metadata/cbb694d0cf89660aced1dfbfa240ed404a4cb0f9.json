The inspector forcefully carries Basanti to Nata's place where she is whipped brutally. She denies to play the flute to call Chandra because she knew that the snake would be eliminated from the scene. Surya tries to come to the rescue, he is beaten. In protest a group of snakes arrive and start biting Nata's men. Nata tries to escape but is caught. Basanti now takes her revenge and fatally whips him. At the end as per the title of the film, revenge is taken and harmony is restored.\n\n\nScreenshot: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/wd9kt16h3/Thumbs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/wd9kt16h3/Thumbs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbb694d0cf89660aced1dfbfa240ed404a4cb0f9","amp;dn":"Aamar+Mayer+Shapath+%282003%29+Bengali+Movie+WebRip+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbb694d0cf89660aced1dfbfa240ed404a4cb0f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,182,148,208,207,137,102,10,206,209,223,191,162,64,237,64,74,76,176,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
