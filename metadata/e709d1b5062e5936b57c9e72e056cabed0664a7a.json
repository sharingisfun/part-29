Each word had its own tune.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The Music and Chinese Studies course at Sheffield University took Leaverland to Nanjing, and when she by chance came across auditions for the talent competition she, typically, wanted to get involved. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI really thought they would want a Chinese person to win. I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe it when it was me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nLeaverland remained virtually unknown in the UK. The show was not broadcast outside of China, so her family and friends could not watch it. When an interview she gave to a local Gloucester paper was picked up by the national press, the news spread, and Leaverland was offered several recording contracts. Her debut album &quot;Shine&quot; was released on the 8th of August.\n\n256kbps mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e709d1b5062e5936b57c9e72e056cabed0664a7a","amp;dn":"Mary-Jess+Leaverland+-+Shine+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e709d1b5062e5936b57c9e72e056cabed0664a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,9,209,181,6,46,89,54,181,124,158,114,224,86,202,190,208,102,74,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
