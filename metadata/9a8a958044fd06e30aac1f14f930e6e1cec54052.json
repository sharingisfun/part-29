There is a mood of personal reflection hanging over the entire proceeding, inspired by the death of Wainwright's father, a noted American writer and editor. &quot;People in Love&quot; kicks the whole thing off with one of Wainwright's trademark observations on the perils of love. On &quot;Men,&quot; the singer quietly discusses the whys and wherefores of male behavior, while &quot;The Picture&quot; is a musical reflection on a picture of Loudon and his sister taken 40 years earlier (and reproduced inside the CD booklet). The album then continues with a clever classic of the satirical talking folk-blues genre, &quot;Talking New Bob Dylan,&quot; in which Wainwright, once considered one of the many &quot;new Dylans,&quot; salutes the original on his 50th birthday. The last three songs on the album form a powerful triumvirate, with &quot;A Father and a Son&quot; written by a man who is both, and &quot;Sometimes I Forget,&quot; an extremely personal ballad about the loss of his own dad. The final track, &quot;A Handful of Dust,&quot; was actually written by Loudon Wainwright, Jr. in 1952 and adapted by his son for this recording. For those familiar with Loudon Wainwright III only through his novelty hit &quot;Dead Skunk,&quot; or who don't know his work at all, History will come as a revelation. For the small cult of Wainwright fans, its power and poignancy may also come as a wonderful surprise, for it's the album his previous work hinted might be within him. It is his masterpiece.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/07/loudon-wainwright-iii/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/07/loudon-wainwright-iii/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a8a958044fd06e30aac1f14f930e6e1cec54052","amp;dn":"Loudon+Wainwright+III...History%281992%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a8a958044fd06e30aac1f14f930e6e1cec54052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,138,149,128,68,253,6,227,10,172,31,20,249,48,230,225,206,197,64,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
