GOOGLE 'start loving.' Also GOOGLE, 'tracking plan b'  So, I'm working with a 23,400 calorie deficit, and a sleep deficit the last 4 days of near 8 hrs x 4 = 32 hours, so I can get this done, before I am.

This project, on now a 4 day near zero sleep sprint, may be A. one of the wonders of human endurance, or B. full of technical disasters, errors....  I've devoted my life to have it be the former.  If it is the latter, ROFL, I WON'T BE AROUND FOR YOU TO WHINE AT, RIDICULE, BLAME!!!!  FIX IT, BUILD ON IT. DO YOUR PART!

Since his death in police custody, he has been called a martyr of the anti-apartheid movement.[4] While living, his writings and activism attempted to empower black people, and he was famous for his slogan &quot;black is beautiful&quot;, which he described as meaning: &quot;man, you are okay as you are, begin to look upon yourself as a human being&quot;.[5]\n\nDespite friction between the African National Congress and Biko throughout the 1970s[need quotation to verify] the ANC has included Biko in the pantheon of struggle heroes, going as far as using his image for campaign posters in South Africa's first non-racial elections in 1994.[6]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c514de38d127a7b817d7bd0406e86d2e0a546d","amp;dn":"Biko+%5BMP3%5D+Donald+Woods+-+ScanSoft+Daniel+reads","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6c514de38d127a7b817d7bd0406e86d2e0a546d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,197,20,222,56,209,39,167,184,23,215,189,4,6,232,109,46,10,84,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
