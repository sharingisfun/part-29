These are consistent, rhythmic stimuli that entrains and stimulates brainwaves. Isochronic tones are the most effective form of rhythmic stimulus. In essence, an Isochronic tone is an evenly spaced tone-based pulse  which simply turns on and off at a specified rate per second. Because the tones turn off so quickly, they produce extremely strong responses in the brain, which leads to most effective possible brainwave stimulation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe3f9e006eced202eb1b2e79fecbe8cbea266c6","amp;dn":"Brain+Synch+for+Stress+Relief+MP3+USE+W%2F+HEADPHONES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe3f9e006eced202eb1b2e79fecbe8cbea266c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,227,249,224,6,236,237,32,46,177,178,231,159,236,190,140,190,162,102,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
