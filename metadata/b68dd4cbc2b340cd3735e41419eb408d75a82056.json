This incomparable guide helps you make a smooth transition. New York Times columnist and Missing Manuals creator David Pogue gets you past three challenges: transferring your stuff, assembling Mac programs so you can do what you did with Windows, and learning your way around OS X.\n\nLearning to use a Mac is not a piece of cake, but once you do, the rewards are oh-so-much better. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find questionable firewalls or inefficient permissions. Just a beautiful machine with a thoroughly reliable system. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using Windows XP or Windows 7, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got you covered.\n\n- Transfer your stuff. Moving files from a PC to a Mac is the easy part. This guide gets you through the tricky things: extracting your email, address book, calendar, Web bookmarks, buddy list, desktop pictures, and MP3 files.\n- Re-create your software suite. Big-name programs from Microsoft, Adobe, and others are available in both Mac and Windows versions, but hundreds of other programs are Windows-only. Learn the Macintosh equivalents and how to move data to them.\n- Learn OS X Mountain Lion. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve moved into the Macintosh mansion, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to learn your way around. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in good hands with the author of Mac OS X: The Missing Manual, the #1 bestselling guide to OS X.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: Welcome to Macintosh\nChapter 1.
