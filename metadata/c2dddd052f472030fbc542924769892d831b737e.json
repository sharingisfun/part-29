Although they were put together for the sake of a TV show, The Monkees were one of the most successful bands in the world during their mid-'60s heyday. This 36 song collection features hits and album tracks, proving to be a wonderful introduction to the band. Includes 'Last Train To Clarksville', 'I'm A Believer', 'For Pete's Sake', 'Daydream Believer', 'Pleasant Valley Sunday' and many others.\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] (Theme From) The Monkees\n[02] Last Train To Clarksville\n[03] I'm A Believer\n[04] (I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\n[05] A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\n[06] Daydream Believer\n[07] I Wanna Be Free\n[08] She\n[09] Mary Mary\n[10] The Girl I Knew Somewhere\n[11] Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)\n[12] Shades Of Gray\n[13] Sometime In The Morning\n[14] Alternate Title (Randy Scouse Git)\n[15] You Just May Be The One\n[16] Pleasant Valley Sunday\n[17] Words\n[18] Take A Giant Step\n\nDisc 01 Play Time 00h:46m:55s\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] Valleri\n[02] D.W.
