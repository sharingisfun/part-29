Andrzej Wrotniak\nLicense/Price\t: $40.00 USD\nSize / OS\t: 953 KB / Windows All\nLast Updated\t: July 11th, 2005, 14:49 UTC\nTrial Limit\t: Some functions are disabled\n\nDescription:\n\nAdvanced Sci/Eng calculator, from simple expressions to differential equations\n\nThe Mother of all Calculators, a Swiss Army knife for scientists and engineers. Perhaps the most capable scientific/engineering calculator for Windows.\n\nOn one hand, this is a calculator: evaluates expressions with more than 100 functions (trig/inverse, log/exp, statisical distributions, Euler, conditional, user-defined. Expressions are entered in the customary algebraic notation, and only then evaluated.\n\nAfter computing the value, an expression can be modified or corrected, and recomputed at will. There ara also unit conversions, physical constants, computer math (binary, octal, hex), and function graphs included.\n\nMost importantly, advanced features don't obstruct the basic ones. You can use as much of Kalkulator's capabilities as you need, without being hampered by the program capabilities you do not need. Disk save/restore, Help file and other niceties are also included.\n\nKalkulator has been evolving on various OS platforms for the last 15 years, being refined and polished through all this time, and its author has more than 25 years of active experience in numerical methods and software development.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;Kalkulator&quot;:\n\nÃ‚Â· numerical integration and differentiation,\nÃ‚Â· interpolaton (linear or cubic spline),\nÃ‚Â· statistics (mean, s.d., histograms, polynomial regression),\nÃ‚Â· column operations on stat data,\nÃ‚Â· polynomial roots, linear algebra (vector/matrix operations and systems of linear equations).\nÃ‚Â· systems of non-linear and differential (ODE) equations,\nÃ‚Â· multi-argument function extremum search and point or histogram fitting with an arbitrary function.\n\nWhat's New in This Release:\nÃ‚Â· Added new function; user function descriptions\n\n==================================================================================\nAbout this Patch: Math and Eng is not my field, so i need your help to try this patch and let me know if everything run as it should. Thanks in advance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0cccbbe29187bda688a67e7d8a05edee24e549b","amp;dn":"Education+Software+%3A+Advanced+Sci+%26amp%3B+Eng+Kalkulator+v2.41","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0cccbbe29187bda688a67e7d8a05edee24e549b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,204,203,190,41,24,123,218,104,138,103,231,216,160,94,222,226,78,84,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
