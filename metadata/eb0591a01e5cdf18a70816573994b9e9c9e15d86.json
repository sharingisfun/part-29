COME A LONG WAY\n\n__________\n\nClean, upbeat music with inspired lyrics After revisiting this album \nfor the first time in eleven years, I cant imagine why Id forgotten \nabout it to begin with. perhaps the fact that I had owned it on LP \noriginally, and my record player has long since bit the dust?\n\nOnce Upon a Time by Simple Minds is simply amazing, because Im just \na music fan who cant sing or play anything worth a lick, I lack the \nmusical language to describe Simple Minds style beyond comparing them\nto other bands of their time. \n\nSuperficially, this collection sounds like early U2 with a little more\nemphasis on the synthesizers and backup singers. \nThe lyrics even have a similar quasi-spiritual overtone, poetically \nborrowing phrases that could have been Praise and Worship quotes \nbut are probably used to describe human relationships. \n\nFor instance You lift me up like the sweetest cup I share with you is \nfrom Alive and Kicking, and from Sanctify Yourself: \n&quot;So you cant stop the world for a Boy or a Girl, Sweet victims of poor \ncircumstances But you can pour back the Love, Sweeping down from above, \ngiving hope and making more chances Well I hope and I pray that maybe \nsomeday Youll come back down here and show me the way...Open up your \nheart, Sanctify yourself.\n\n__________\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 13.1 MiB\nDuration                         : 5mn 43s\nOverall bit rate                 : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                            : Once Upon A Time\nTrack name                       : Once Upon A Time\nTrack name/Position              : 1\nPerformer                        : Simple Minds\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.2\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nFormat_Settings_Mode             : Joint stereo / MS Stereo\nDuration                         : 5mn 43s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 13.1 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.2\n__________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320\n\nEnjoy:D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0591a01e5cdf18a70816573994b9e9c9e15d86","amp;dn":"Simple+Minds+Once+Upon+A+Time%28mp3+320kbs%29ICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0591a01e5cdf18a70816573994b9e9c9e15d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,5,145,160,30,92,223,24,167,8,22,87,57,148,185,233,201,225,93,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
