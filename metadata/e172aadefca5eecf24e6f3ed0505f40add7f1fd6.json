He felt and heard his chair being knocked over. Something hit him hard in the face. He felt his lower lip give against his teeth. The last time he'd felt that was when he had been kicked in the face by a girl on a rope-swing when he was six years old. She'd swung across the brook and planted him with both feet. No pain. But a kind of rattled dizziness. Roger didn't fall over when he was six and he didn't fall over this time either. A high pitched scream. He made himself focus on the woman by the bar. She screamed again, wide eyed.\nJohn Wilson, Editor, Writer's Workshop, said,\n&quot;... one of the best thrillers I've read in a long, long time... provides enough mysteries, clues, red herrings and twists and turns to last a life time.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e172aadefca5eecf24e6f3ed0505f40add7f1fd6","amp;dn":"Nurse+Becky+Gets+Shot+%28Gary+Baker%29+DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e172aadefca5eecf24e6f3ed0505f40add7f1fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,114,170,222,252,165,238,207,36,230,243,237,5,5,244,10,221,127,31,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
