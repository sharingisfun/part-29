Their musical style encompassed rock and roll and swamp rock genres. Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they are sometimes also cited as southern rock stylists.\n\nCCR's music is still a staple of American and worldwide radio airplay[1] and often figures in various media. The band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone.[2] CCR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChronicle 1976\n\n\nChronicle, Vol. 1, also known as Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits, is a compilation album by Creedence Clearwater Revival, released in 1976. Compared to the two previously released Creedence Gold compilations, Chronicle Vol. 1 features all of the group's charted hits. It is the best selling album in the Creedence catalog with sales of 8 million.\n\nThe original vinyl release contained the 1976 single edit of &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Susie Q&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n2.\t&quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n3.\t&quot;Proud Mary&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n4.\t&quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n5.\t&quot;Lodi&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n6.\t&quot;Green River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n7.\t&quot;Commotion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n8.\t&quot;Down on the Corner&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43\n9.\t&quot;Fortunate Son&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n10.\t&quot;Travelin' Band&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:07\n11.\t&quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27\n12.\t&quot;Up Around the Bend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n13.\t&quot;Run Through the Jungle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n14.\t&quot;Lookin' out My Back Door&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31\n15.\t&quot;Long As I Can See the Light&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n16.\t&quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52 (vinyl and cassette releases; CD version features the full 11:06 version)\n17.\t&quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n18.\t&quot;Hey Tonight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n19.\t&quot;Sweet Hitch-Hiker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n20.\t&quot;Someday Never Comes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daa77e8575be4248abe8b9ce4bd9a77cb9a71db8","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+-+Chronicle+1976+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daa77e8575be4248abe8b9ce4bd9a77cb9a71db8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,167,126,133,117,190,66,72,171,232,185,206,75,217,167,124,185,167,29,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
