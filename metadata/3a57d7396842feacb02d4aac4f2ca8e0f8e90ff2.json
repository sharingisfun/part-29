I also corrected a typo in one of the ID3 tags. This is the exact same torrent as the other World Tour soundtrack except I updated all of the albums, album art, and made some corrections. I did not bother to put the album singles but instead I used the original album. Some albums are difficult to find so I left things such as the live versions of songs in their original mp3 format but labeled them as differently and some albums are non-existent. There are still two songs missing from this torrent. They are the Zakk Wylde and Ted Nugent guitar duels.

I did not make this torrent, I just repackaged it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a57d7396842feacb02d4aac4f2ca8e0f8e90ff2","amp;dn":"Guitar+Hero+World+Tour+Soundtrack+Updated+Again","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a57d7396842feacb02d4aac4f2ca8e0f8e90ff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,87,215,57,104,66,254,172,176,45,74,172,79,44,168,224,248,233,15,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
