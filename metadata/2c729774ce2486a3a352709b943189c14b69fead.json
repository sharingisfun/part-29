Michael Caine stars as Noel Holcroft, who was adopted in Germany by an American family in the waning days of World War II. Now middle-aged, Noel learns that his biological father, who had been one of Hitler's key economic advisors, left him more than $4 billion at his death. Noel is supposed to dispense the money to specific individuals who had suffered under the oppression of Hitler. But Noel comes to realize the money is, in fact, being used by fascists starting a new Nazi regime. When the neo-Nazis find out Noel is wise to their plans, they chase him through Europe, trying to assassinate him and make way for a Fourth Reich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Michael Caine, Anthony Andrews, Victoria Tennant\r\nDIRECTOR......: John Frankenheimer\r\nWRITERS.......: George Axelrod, Edward Anhalt, John Hopkins\r\nGENRE.........: Action | Crime | Drama \r\nIMDB RATING...: 5.7/10  2,028 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089283\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 52mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.42GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1040\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.85:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 4000 Kbps (3-pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English E-AC3 Mono 256kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary with John Frankenheimer\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG   \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Untouched Blu Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-09-01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c729774ce2486a3a352709b943189c14b69fead","amp;dn":"The.Holcroft.Covenant.1985.1080p.BluRay.x264.EAC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c729774ce2486a3a352709b943189c14b69fead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,114,151,116,206,36,134,163,163,82,112,155,148,49,137,193,75,105,254,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
