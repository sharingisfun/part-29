After Ben's murder by Venom, an underling of the Kingpin, Peter starts to train in secret so he will be strong enough to exact his revenge. In this version of Spider-Man, Aunt May is Peter's mother's sister instead of Uncle Ben being his father's brother. The Mangaverse Spider-Man was brought back for his own mini-series, in which he encounters a cybernetic version of the Black Cat, as well as the Venom symbiote. This symbiote does not become Venom and has mystical origins and connections to an 'evil' clan of Ninja who are affiliated with Spiders, apparently a counterpart to Spider-Man's own ninja clan. \n\nMore info: http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man-legend-of-the-spider-clan/49-18501/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1655eca27b6c5fb0f0f3720b652825f4c9be8454","amp;dn":"Spider-Man+-+Legend+Of+The+Spider+Clan+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1655eca27b6c5fb0f0f3720b652825f4c9be8454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,85,236,162,123,108,95,176,240,243,114,11,101,40,37,244,201,190,132,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
