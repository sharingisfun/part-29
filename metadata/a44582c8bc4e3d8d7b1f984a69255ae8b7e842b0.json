At a time \n\nwhen country music already trending toward light, sweet pop music, Sylvia&amp;#039;s \n\nrecords were the aural equivalent of cotton candy, so light they nearly \n\nfloated in the air. Add her good looks to the equation, and she seemed like \n\na model marketed as country to the legions of country purists. And they did \n\nhave a point, since Sylvia&amp;#039;s music was only marginally country. There was a \n\nbit of twang here and there, some traditionally country themes and song \n\nstructures, but it was sugar-coated and polished to a gloss, fitting in \n\nbetter aurally with the soft rock of the time instead of even the \n\ncountry-pop. All this is evident on her 16-track installment of BMG \n\nHeritage&amp;#039;s RCA Country Legends series. What makes this series interesting \n\nis that it doesn&amp;#039;t use the Billboard charts as the sole guideline for \n\ncompilation; instead, it takes the biggest hits and expands them with album \n\ncuts, B-sides, and rarities intended to draw a clearer picture of the \n\nartist&amp;#039;s depth as a country artist. Usually, this has produced some very \n\ninteresting, revealing collections, but it&amp;#039;s an approach that&amp;#039;s kind of odd \n\nfor Sylvia, since her entire career only makes sense in terms of the \n\ncharts, and this comes up short on hits. Of the 16 tracks, only six were \n\nhits, leaving 12 charting hits behind, including big ones like &quot;Fallin&amp;#039; In \n\nLove,&quot; &quot;Snapshot,&quot; &quot;Sweet Yesterday,&quot; and &quot;Like Nothing Ever Happened.&quot; For \n\na chart-oriented artist, that&amp;#039;s a lot of missing material, but RCA Country \n\nLegends still works -- and, in fact, functions as a nice counterpoint to \n\nRenaissance&amp;#039;s comprehensive 1997 hits package Anthology -- because it&amp;#039;s \n\nsequenced well, contains the biggest and best hits, while digging up a few \n\nchoice cuts like &quot;Cry Baby Cry,&quot; &quot;No News Is Good News,&quot; &quot;Tonight I&amp;#039;m \n\nGettin&amp;#039; Friendly With the Blues,&quot; and &quot;Eyes Like Mine&quot; that prove that \n\nSylvia did depth outside of the charts. That said, RCA Country Legends \n\nwon&amp;#039;t change any minds about her musical attributes -- this is still very \n\nsoft country-pop, and even condensed to a collection, there are a few duff \n\nmoments here and there -- but for those that like Sylvia or early-&amp;#039;80s soft \n\nrock, this is quite enjoyable and nearly as an effective an introduction to \n\nher as the hit-laden Anthology\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44582c8bc4e3d8d7b1f984a69255ae8b7e842b0","amp;dn":"Sylvia+-+RCA+Country+Legend+%5B2002%2F224kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44582c8bc4e3d8d7b1f984a69255ae8b7e842b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,69,130,200,188,78,61,141,123,31,152,74,105,37,90,232,183,232,66,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
