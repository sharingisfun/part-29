She created quite a stir in France at the time of the release of the novel, due to her youth and beauty, and appeared on national television, in particular in the show of Bernard Pivot. She also appeared in a pictorial and an interview of the May 1993 issue of the French edition of Penthouse magazine.\n\nDuriÃƒÂ¨s died in a car crash on December 13, 1993 in the South of France at age 21. Because of her early death, she has achieved a cult status for some BDSM communities. In 2007, five chapters of her second novel L'Ãƒâ€°tudiante, left unfinished due to her death, were published in France.\n\nThree other people also died in the crash. The 2007 edition published in Paris by J'ai Lu -- &quot;L'Ãƒâ€°tudiante suivi de Le Lien&quot;, Ãƒâ€°ditions Blanche, ISBN 978-2-290-00617-7 Ã¢â‚¬â€ which includes an avant-propos by DuriÃƒÂ¨s' editor Franck Spengler and a preface by Florence Dugas, is dedicated: &quot;Ãƒâ‚¬ la mÃƒÂ©moire de Vanessa DuriÃƒÂ¨s, Nathalie Perreau, Jean-Pierre Imbrohoris et leur fils dÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©s tragiquement le 13 dÃƒÂ©cembre 1993&quot;. \n\nSpengler avows he was editor to Nathalie Perreau, also, and a friend of Jean-Pierre Imbrohoris. Published in this edition is a short letter written by DuriÃƒÂ¨s to Franck Spengler, inserted between chapters two and three of &quot;L'Ãƒâ€°tudiante&quot;.\n\nL'etudiante has never been translated into English. This is an unauthorized fan translation. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26426bd6cd599aefec1827d443c081a6dd3113f9","amp;dn":"classmate_duries.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26426bd6cd599aefec1827d443c081a6dd3113f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,66,107,214,205,89,154,239,236,24,39,212,67,192,129,166,221,49,19,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
