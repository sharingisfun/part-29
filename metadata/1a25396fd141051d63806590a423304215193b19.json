Two weeks later, in his third appearance, he sang a song that literally changed the world of popular music: &quot;Heartbreak Hotel.&quot; Its unique sound and style literally blew away everything that came before it, while at the same time introducing the musical blueprint for everything that was to come. RCA Victor released his iconic debut album &quot;Elvis Presley,&quot; which topped the Billboard chart for 10 weeks and became RCA's biggest-selling album to date, on March 23 of that year. As Presley took America and the world by storm, the follow-up album &quot;Elvis&quot; was released to feverish demand on October 19 that same year, remaining at #1 for 5 weeks.\n\nThis new 2-CD Legacy Edition includes both of these classic original albums in their entirety and adds 12 bonus tracks, including the hit singles &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; &quot;Don't Be Cruel,&quot; &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; &quot;I Want You, I Need You, I Love You,&quot; &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; and &quot;Too Much,&quot; a run of #1 hits that collectively held the top spot in the Billboard Singles Chart for 6 months.\n\nBy the end of 1956, the songs featured in this package accounted for over 13 million in sales. Digitally remastered, these are the recordings that changed popular music forever and made Elvis the world's first rock icon.
