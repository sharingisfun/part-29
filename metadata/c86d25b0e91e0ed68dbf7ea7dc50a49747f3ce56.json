The bulk of the songs are either mainstream rock tracks (&quot;Hollywood Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Chance on a Feeling&quot;) or, specifically on Side Two, a series of very English classical piano ballads sung by mother and daughter duo, Vicki Brown and Sam Brown (wife and daughter of entertainer Joe Brown) and vocalist Elmer Gantry. The album also features prolific session drummer (and National Youth Jazz Orchestra alumnus) Simon Phillips, Cozy Powell, Neil Murray, Simon Kirke, Boz Burrell and Mick Ralphs. Lord used synthesizers more than before, principally to retain an intimacy with the material and to create a jam atmosphere with old friends like Tony Ashton.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n    &quot;Chance on a Feeling&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:06\n    &quot;Tender Babes&quot; (O Ye Tender Babes) (Thomas Tallis, arr. by Jon Lord) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n    &quot;Hollywood Rock And Roll Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:06\n    &quot;Bach Onto This&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:59\n    &quot;Before I Forget&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:04\n    &quot;Say Its Alright&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:47\n    &quot;Burntwood&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n    &quot;Where Are You?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:00\n\nCD reissue bonus tracks (1999)\n\n    &quot;Going Home&quot;\n    &quot;Pavane&quot;\n    &quot;Lady&quot;\n    &quot;For A Friend&quot;\n    &quot;Jon Lord Interview&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Jon Lord: Piano, Organ, Keyboards, Mini Moog\n    Bernie Marsden: Guitar (1, 4), lead vocals (1)\n    Mick Ralphs: Guitar (3, 6)\n    Tony Ashton: Lead vocals (3)\n    Elmer Gantry: Lead vocals (8)\n    Vicky Brown: Lead vocals (2, 11), backing vocals (1, 3, 5, 6)\n    Sam Brown: Backing vocals (1, 3, 5, 6)\n    Boz Burrell: Bass guitar (3)\n    Neil Murray: Bass guitar (1, 2, 4-7)\n    Ian Paice: Drums (1, 5)\n    Cozy Powell: Drums (2)\n    Simon Phillips: Drums (4, 6)\n    Simon Kirke: Drums (3)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86d25b0e91e0ed68dbf7ea7dc50a49747f3ce56","amp;dn":"Jon+Lord+-+Before+I+Forget+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86d25b0e91e0ed68dbf7ea7dc50a49747f3ce56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,109,37,176,233,30,14,214,141,191,126,167,220,80,164,151,71,243,206,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
