He can play in just about any style -- from swing to bop to R&amp;B to pop -- with supreme taste, a beautiful rounded tone, terrific speed, a marvelous sense of logic in building solos, and, always, an unquenchable urge to swing. His inspirations may have been Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery -- and he can do dead-on impressions of both -- but his style is completely his own. Not only can he play lead brilliantly, he is also one of the best rhythm guitarists around, supportive to soloists and a dangerous swinger, particularly in a soul-jazz format. Yet Benson can also sing in a lush, soulful tenor with mannerisms similar to those of Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway, and it is his voice that has proved to be more marketable to the public than his guitar. Benson is the guitar-playing equivalent of Nat King Cole -- a fantastic pianist whose smooth way with a pop vocal eventually eclipsed his instrumental prowess in the marketplace -- but unlike Cole, Benson has been granted enough time after his fling with the pop charts to reaffirm his jazz guitar credentials, which he still does at his concerts. \n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.84% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tR2 78284\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.This Masquerade\n02.Breezin'\n03.Greatest Love Of All\n04.On Broadway (Live)\n05.Love Ballad\n06.Unchained Melody\n07.Give Me The Night\n08.Love X Love\n09.Turn Your Love Around\n10.Love All The Hurt Away (With Aretha Franklin)\n11.Never Give Up On A Good Thing\n12.Being With You\n13.Lady Love Me (One More Time)\n14.2020\n15.I Just Wanna Hang Around You\n16.Kisses In The Moonlight\n17.Shiver\n18.Let's Do It Again\n19.Standing Together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d503a4909cc99e92ec3b2be4240210a2f8a1cdc3","amp;dn":"George+Benson+-+The+Greatest+Hits+Of+All+%282003%29++%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d503a4909cc99e92ec3b2be4240210a2f8a1cdc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,3,164,144,156,201,158,146,236,59,43,228,36,2,16,162,248,161,205,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
