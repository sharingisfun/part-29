To the people of Tantalus, Duke is a hero and savior. Now, he's their last chance to vanquish the new menace that has invaded the peace-loving world he left behind. But four decades have passed: Duke's not the young man he once was, and the enemy he faces is more powerful than anything he faced in the good old days. The stakes are raised, and the weight of Duke's own conscience might be his heaviest burden yet!\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af4dd460e2f3d110c5716495e75b5e1a2690cd08","amp;dn":"Starlight+03+%282014%29+%282+cvrs+1440%2B2048px-HD%29+%28theProletariat-Novu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af4dd460e2f3d110c5716495e75b5e1a2690cd08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,77,212,96,226,243,209,16,197,113,100,149,231,91,94,26,38,144,205,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
