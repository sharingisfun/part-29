In addition, effective website development requires optimum performance with regard to both the web browser and server. Taking those factors into consideration, this platform-neutral book covers all aspects of building and maintaining websites that deliver peak performance on all levels. Longtime web developer and performance expert Peter Smith explores the ways in which websites can respond more quickly by configuring front-end performance related to the web browser, as well as the back end for speeding up the communication between the server and the browser.\n\nProfessional Website Performance:\n- Examines factors such as compression and JavaScript, database performance, MySQL tuning, NoSQL alternatives, load-balancing across multiple servers, effective caching of web contents, CSS, and more\n- Walks you through minimizing the performance penalties of SSL\n- Discusses the dangers of premature optimization and how it can add complexity to your code\n- Looks at waterfall views at the front end of a website, which show the order in which the browser is requesting resources\n- Addresses scaling horizontally (increasing the number of machines in your setup) versus scaling vertically (keeping the same number of servers, but upgrading their hardware)\n\nTable of Contents\nPART I: FRONT END\nChapter 1.
