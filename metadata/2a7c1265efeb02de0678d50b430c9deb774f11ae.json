He   \n    heads to Yorkshire, the home of forced rhubarb, to meet   \n    plucky growers who continue with their traditional         \n    labour-intensive methods and who have triumphed in the    \n    face of adversity. In the Revival kitchen, Gregg aims    \n    to prove that rhubarb has far more to offer than just     \n    the filling for good old-fashioned crumble.                \n                                                              \n    Meanwhile, Ainsley Harriott wants us to remember the     \n    taste of a fresh pea straight from the pod. There is no   \n    doubt that peas are popular but over ninety percent of     \n    those we grow are frozen. Ainsley argues that we're       \n    missing out on one our homegrown treats if we don't eat  \n    them fresh when they're in season. Even HRH Prince        \n    Charles is rooting for the fresh pea, as Ainsley           \n    discovers when he visits the kitchen garden at            \n    Highgrove House.                                         \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016pcly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016pcly&lt;/a&gt;            \n                                                              \n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.tvrage.com/Great_British_Food_Revival&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.tvrage.com/Great_British_Food_Revival&lt;/a&gt;     \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a7c1265efeb02de0678d50b430c9deb774f11ae","amp;dn":"Great.British.Food.Revival.S02E02.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a7c1265efeb02de0678d50b430c9deb774f11ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,124,18,101,239,235,2,222,6,120,213,11,67,12,157,235,119,79,17,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
