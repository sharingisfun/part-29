First he tries to teach Tanner and Rut how to play football--with an automotive twist. Then he reveals his own concept car designed to protect you against the worst things on the road--other drivers. Finally, he gets behind the wheel of the legendary Ford GT40 and puts a bizarre twist on the classic Le Mans race where Ford beat Ferrari, with an unsuspecting Rutledge at the wheel of the Ferrari.\n\n\nDon't forget to say thanks! ;)\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7635e0a654b7483edf719dece563f2b9d72a475","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.US.S03E12.HDTV.x264-SHO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7635e0a654b7483edf719dece563f2b9d72a475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,99,94,10,101,75,116,131,237,247,25,222,206,86,63,43,157,114,164,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
