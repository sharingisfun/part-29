It was released on September 1, 2009, on Barsuk Records. It is rated 82/100 by critics on Metacritic, earning it the distinction of &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.\n\nThe album was recorded from early 2008 to mid-2009 by David Bazan in his basement studio near Seattle, Washington. Additional recording, mixing, and mastering was done by long-time collaborator and former Pedro the Lion member T. W. Walsh at his studio in Massachusetts.\n\nThe album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and #116 on the Billboard 200 the week of its release.\n\nThe same day as this album was released, Bazan also put out a single covering Bob Dylan's &quot;The Man in Me&quot; backed with Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\n* David Bazan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitar, drums, synthesizer, bass guitar, piano, engineering, production\n\nAdditional musicians:\n\n* David H.

Here, though, the doubt that Bazan has always scratched at takes a firmer, more certain form: &quot;I clung to miracles I have not seen,&quot; he admits in &quot;Bearing Witness,&quot; &quot;From ancient autographs I cannot read.&quot;\n\nThe past tense there is crucial: &quot;Curse Your Branches&quot; documents Bazan's coming to terms with his newfound agnosticism, a change of heart he credits in &quot;When We Fell&quot; to his inability to accept &quot;the threat of hell hanging over my head like a halo.&quot; (&quot;In what medieval kingdom does justice work this way?&quot; he wonders later in that song.)\n\nDespite its undercurrent of outrage, &quot;Branches&quot; -- which expands Pedro's folksy sound with creamy keyboards, processed drum beats and the occasional spritz of glam-rock guitar -- is no shorter on moral compassion than the older material that earned Bazan a home at Cornerstone, the annual Christian music festival that he played this summer for the first time since 2005, when he was asked to leave after showing up drunk for a performance.\n\nPerhaps that's because Bazan, who plays the Troubadour Oct. 4, still views his work as evangelical in nature: &quot;I discovered hell to be the poison in the well,&quot; he sings in &quot;Bless This Mess,&quot; &quot;So I tried to warn the others of the curse.&quot;\n\n--Mikael Wood\n\n\nReview from:http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/08/album-review-david-bazans-curse-your-branches.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
