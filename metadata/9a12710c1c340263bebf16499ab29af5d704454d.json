Kahnweiler, Ph.D\n2009 \nEnglish\nISBN: 1576755770 \nPDF \n169 Pages\n1.01 MB\n\n\nIn our extroverted business culture, introverts can feel excluded, overlooked, or misunderstood. But being an introvert doesn't mean you can't be a great leader. Citing examples of highly successful leaders like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, Kahnweiler shows that introverts can build on their quiet strength and make it a source of great power.\n\nAfter highlighting the common challenges introverts face at work, such as stress, invisibility, and perception gaps, the book details a straightforward four-step process to handle work situations such as managing up, leading projects, public speaking, and many more. Kahnweiler provides numerous examples and leadership tips as well as a revealing Introverted Leader Quiz that pinpoints where focused attention will produce maximum results, &quot;The Introverted Leader&quot; will teach you to embrace your natural work style in order to advance your career, get the most out of the people around you, and add value to your organization.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a12710c1c340263bebf16499ab29af5d704454d","amp;dn":"The+Introverted+Leader%3A+Building+on+Your+Quiet+Strength-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a12710c1c340263bebf16499ab29af5d704454d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,18,113,12,28,52,2,99,190,191,22,73,154,178,154,245,215,4,69,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
