It was released in 2003 on his Iso Records label, in conjunction with Columbia Records.\nA contemporary review of the album by the BBC called the album &quot;a proper album, with a beginning, a middle and an end. It's direct, warm, emotional honest, even and the surfeit of pleasingly deceptive musical simplicity allows the irony of the central concept - that there is no such thing as reality anymore - an opportunity to filter through. It's also rather lively and convincing.&quot; The same review called this and his earlier album Earthling Bowie's &quot;best album since Scary Monsters.&quot;\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: APE+.cue (lossless)\n\nTracklist:\n01 New Killer Star\n02 Pablo Picasso\n03 Never Get Old\n04 The Loneliest Guy\n05 Looking For Water\n06 She'll Drive The Big Car\n07 Days\n08 Fall Dog Bombs The Moon\n09 Try Some, Buy Some\n10 Reality\n11 Bring Me The Disco King\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:823369d83e60fd2b7903aea1d74acb6d6ab5c7ae","amp;dn":"%282003%29+David+Bowie+-+Reality+%5BAPE%2B.cue%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"823369d83e60fd2b7903aea1d74acb6d6ab5c7ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,51,105,216,62,96,253,43,121,3,174,161,215,74,203,109,106,181,199,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
