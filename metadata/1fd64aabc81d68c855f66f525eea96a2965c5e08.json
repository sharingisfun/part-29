I also utilized several other audio editing programs. This upmix can only be played on PCs and home theater/audio systems capable of decoding and playing DTS files. You can burn it to a DVD using the ISO file. I recommend ImgBurn for best results.\n\nThe Turtles were one of the consistent Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhit singleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bands of the 1960Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. They are obviously best known for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happy TogetherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but they were able to pull off some big hits even when they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trying. For example, Their record company, White Whale, put such heavy pressure on them to come up with another Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happy TogetherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hit that they purposely wrote what they thought would be a song so blatantly dippy that it would flop and they could go on experimenting with other styles. The resulting intended flop was Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElenoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gee, I think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re swell.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Instead, it too became a major hit for them as the public assumed it was suppose to seem dippy. That was part of the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charm. A key theme that runs through most of The Turtles music is that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take themselves too seriously. That is not to say they are a Ã¢â‚¬ËœjokeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ band, but they were always more about having a good time than machismo strutting.\n\nCheck out their history here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-turtles-mn0000564239&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-turtles-mn0000564239&lt;/a&gt;\nand here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theturtles.com/documents/history.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theturtles.com/documents/history.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe tracks for the upmix were taken from various CD compilations and full album releases. No one compilation (to my ears) had the best sound on every track, so these come from Rhino, Laser Light, Repertoire and other label collections. I chose what I felt was the best sounding version for each track. There are a few rarities mixed in too. The songs are generally grouped in chronological order, so you can get a sense of how there music developed and grew through their career. Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (Flo &amp; Eddie) are still touring as The Turtles today. Their live shows are a lot of fun. Go see them if you get the chance.\n\nAlso, find the movie Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Dinner With JimiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. It is the true story of the night the Turtles met Jimi Hendrix. Great stuff.\n\nThere are slides for each track so turn on your TV/Monitor when you play this program.\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the track list:\n1. WANDERING KIND\n2. GLITTER AND GOLD\n3. IT AIN'T ME BABE\n4.
