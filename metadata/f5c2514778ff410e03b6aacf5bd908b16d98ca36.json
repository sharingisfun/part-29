Patch notes below and please help seed.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€”ï¿½\n\nMajor New Features \n\n- Companion AI - You may now set your companions to use AI. For those of you that do not want to micromanage your party, you may now choose to have the AI perform basic commands for you. You can activate and deactivate the AI control at any time, so you can still have ultimate party control when you need it. Each class has specialized AI packages and we will be adding more in the future. \n\n- Improved Creature AI - Creatures and NPCs will now act more intelligently and make better use of their abilities and spells. \n\n- Character Retraining - You may now retrain your character and modify their stats for a small fee. \n\n- Individual Stealth - You may now place individual party members into scouting mode. If some of your party enters combat you will no longer have your entire party leave stealth. \n\n- Range Indicators - There are now range indicators to let you know the casting range of spells and abilities. Now you will know if your wizard is going to move before he casts that Fireball. =) \n\n- Accuracy Indicators - You are now shown the chance to hit on all attacks, abilities, and spells by mousing-over a potential target. \n\nFixed Issues \n\nAreas: \n- Fixed issue where Calisca was not being teleported after resting in the Ruin Interior. \n\nAttributes, Abilities, Spells, and Skills: \n- Changed Perception bonus from Deflection to Accuracy. \n- Fixed crash that could happen if a Wizard had the Blast ability and targeting many targets. \n- Increased Constitution bonus to Endurance and Health from 3% to 5%. \n- Changed lockpicking so that it now uses three lockpicks if the lock is above your level, one lockpick if the lock is equal to your level, and no lockpicks if the lock is below your level. \n\nAudio: \n- Polished many sound effects around the game. \n- Fixed weapon ineffective voice over that was playing at incorrect times. \n- Fixed a problem where pausing the game could cause VO and/or barkstrings to finish early. \n\nGameplay: \n- Fixed a problem where friendly auras could grow in size after a save and load. \n- Fixed an issue where chant effects were considered item effects for stacking purposes. This was causing incorrect bonus calculation. \n- Suppressed &quot;Target Destroyed&quot; autopausing if target was the last target in the combat. This will prevent automatic pauses at the end of combat. \n- Figurines now have summon durations. \n- Chanter invocations now have durations. \n- Speed item mod now works correctly. \n- Improved resting bonuses from the Stronghold. \n- Noble's Rest Intelligence bonus lowered to +2. \n- Scroll of Missile Barrage to be combat only. \n- Fixed a problem where stealing part of a stack wasn't registered as stealing. \n- Stealing now only loses reputation once per container. \n- We now have immunities in the game. Some creatures have been updated to make use of them. I'm looking at you blights and dragons... \n- Changed amount of Health that are healed with Wound Binding and Field Triage. \n- Looting equipment off of enemies unequips it from their dead body. \n- Autosave system now uses 3 rolling autosaves instead of one. \n- Improved quality of font text when the game is at a higher resolution than 1920x1200. stracting.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€“Â¬Ã¢â€”ï¿½\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/pillars_of_eternity_hero_edition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/pillars_of_eternity_hero_edition&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c2514778ff410e03b6aacf5bd908b16d98ca36","amp;dn":"Pillars+Of+Eternity+%28Linux%29+%28Latest+With+2.0+Patch%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c2514778ff410e03b6aacf5bd908b16d98ca36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,194,81,71,120,255,65,14,3,182,170,207,91,217,8,177,109,152,202,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
