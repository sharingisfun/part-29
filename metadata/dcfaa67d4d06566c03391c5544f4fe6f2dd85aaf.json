The most interesting of        \n      these is no doubt Tony Clifton (aka Andy Kaufman, or so        \n      it is believed). The only explanation for this has to be       \n      that Taxi was about to premiere its final season on NBC,       \n      after ABC (on which this special aired) had cancelled it.      \n      It's no doubt an interesting pairing.                          \n                                             Enjoy!                  \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                                \n                                                                      \n                              ~HO HO HO~                              \n                                                                     \n                                                               \n                 For the month of December we've decided to      \n                do something special.
