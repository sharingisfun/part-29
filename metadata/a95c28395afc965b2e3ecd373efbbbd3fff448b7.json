Please remember, this was the first, among the Hungarian un-licensed Star Wars Comics, and it was the success of this one, which convinced the authors to come out with Star Wars: Episode IV in a 2 booklets format, a bit later, but the same year, in 1982 also.\n\nAs for the ENG text, I followed suits with the previous one, so I used the aXXo Rip's ENG subtitles as base. Some changes were made compared to the original Hungarian text, erased the numbering of the pictures, and enhanced the picture quality a bit.\n\nThe scan was provided by kyriee, to whom I hereby would like to say a big thanxXx!\n\nThe ENG scan of the  1st booklet of Fazekas' Return of the Jedi will be arriving sometime in the summer of 2013, hopefully.\n\nAs for the next ENG scan of Fazekas' other works, I am just about to start working on his adaptation of Polish classic: The Pharaon. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nCheck Fazekas' Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope also on piratebay:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8198702/Fazekas__Star_Wars_Episode_IV_ENG_SWATura-OD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8198702/Fazekas__Star_Wars_Episode_IV_ENG_SWATura-OD&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck SWATura torrents for other hard-to-find classics!\n\n(K) Kopyleft 2013 - All Rites Reversed...\n\np.s.
