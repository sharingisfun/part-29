The sixteen-year-old US gymnast was performing arguably the best vault of all time, launching herself unimaginably high into the air and sticking a flawless landing. But when her score came, many were baffled: 16.233. Three tenths of a point in deductions stood between her and a perfect score. But if that vault wasnâ€™t perfection, what was?\r\n\r\nFor years, gymnastics was scored on a 10.0 scale. During this era, more than 100 â€œperfectâ€ scores were awarded in major international competitions. But when the 10.0 scoring system caused major judging controversies at the 2004 Olympics, international elite gymnastics made the switch to the open-ended scoring system it uses today, making perfect scores a thing of the pastâ€”and forever altering the sport in the process.\r\n\r\nGymnastics insider Dvora Meyers examines the evolution of elite womenâ€™s gymnastics over the last few decades. With insight, flair, and a boundless love for the sport, Meyers answers questions that gymnastics fans have been asking since the last perfect score was handed out over twenty years ago. She reveals why successful female gymnasts are older and more athletic than they have ever been before, how the United States became a gymnastics powerhouse, and what the future of gymnastics will hold.\r\n\r\nBolstered by dozens of exclusive interviews with professionals representing every aspect of the sport, The End of the Perfect 10 explores a crucial change in one of the most popular Olympic sports, and is a captivating account of elite gymnasticsâ€™ entry into the uncharted world of imperfection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:042f465f196820888496ab4f11736474e6512f8a","amp;dn":"Dvora+Meyers+-+The+End+Of+The+Perfect+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"042f465f196820888496ab4f11736474e6512f8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,47,70,95,25,104,32,136,132,150,171,79,17,115,100,116,230,81,47,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
