Legend has it that the spirits of those many suicides are still roaming-haunting deep in those ancient woods. This series from the creators of the acclaimed The Veil examines the lives of Alan, an average worker from Tokyo and his rather unhealthy relationship with Masami, and Ryoko, a forest ranger who recovers the suicide victim\\'s bodies from the woods. We discover that behind Ryoko\\'s unconcerned surface lies a secret, and these three lives will be forever changed by the darkness waiting for them in the Suicide Forest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f26dae7dffa193fa23f6bc2b85e1b2deee9caf0e","amp;dn":"Suicide+Forest+Issues+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f26dae7dffa193fa23f6bc2b85e1b2deee9caf0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,109,174,125,255,161,147,250,35,246,188,43,133,225,178,222,238,156,175,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
