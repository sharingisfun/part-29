I just want to reconcile humans with this class that has a lot of class - insects !&quot;.\n\n\n\nGeorges Brossard is the creator and mastermind of the INSECTIA series. His enthusiasm is infectious, his anecdotes are fascinating, his explanations are captivating, and his parallels between the worlds of man and insects are daring. Brossard's approach is straightforward, and his vision, wide-ranging. This great communicator tackles the subject of entomology with a passion nurtured by twenty years of research, on-site expeditions, and lobbying to overcome the seemingly insurmountable barrier which exists between people and the natural sciences. To Georges Brossard, the world of insects is not merely a reason for living but life itself. A celebration of life on this planet - that is the essence of INSECTIA.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/3044/insectia2screen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/3044/insectia2screen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XVID\n * Video Bitrate: 3943 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720x1280 (height x width)\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 9x16 (1:1,78)\n * Audio Codec: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3) \n * Audio BitRate: 384 kbps\n * Audio Streams: 1\n * RunTime Per Part: 22 min 31,38 s (40501 Frames)\n * Part Size: 698,82 MB\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27ec14bb0903f1dda5c7c395aca30b52cd53ebe8","amp;dn":"Insectia2+Scorpions+HR+DivX6+AC3+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27ec14bb0903f1dda5c7c395aca30b52cd53ebe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,236,20,187,9,3,241,221,165,199,195,149,172,163,11,82,205,83,235,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
