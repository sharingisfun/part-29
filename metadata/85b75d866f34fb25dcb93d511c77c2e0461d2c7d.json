Many years ago, my 'Tropico' cd was stolen.  It is my all time favorite by Pat.  I read that there was a 'Black Triangle' pressing of Tropico, so I went on a mad hunt on the web to try and find a copy to purchase....with every intent of sharing.  Much to \nmy surprise, I found a not very well seeded download of it on a pretty obscure \nsite.  This is it.  The file was lossless but in a format that was very difficult to extract, well it was for me.  After jumping through many hoops, I succeeded in getting a flac file.  IMHO, the quality is excellent.  I have left the original uploader's scans, log and EAC cue sheet in tact.  The file is a single file because I didn't want to extract the tracks for fear I might lose some quality.  But it will burn as separate tracks using EAC.  You can also extract the tracks using Foobar or Medieval Cue Splitter, (free programs.)\n\nMany thanks to the orignal uploader.\n\nIn the next few days:  Black Triangle pressing of &quot;Seven The Hard Way&quot; and the first Japan pressing of &quot;Wide Awake in Dreamland.'\n\nCD: Pat Benatar - Tropico (Japan 1St Press CP32-5030 Black Triangle)\n\n01.
