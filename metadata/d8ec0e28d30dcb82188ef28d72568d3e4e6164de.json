In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, including acts like The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Porno For Pyros and Super Furry Animals. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur, and Oasis who drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock, particularly on the album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000) In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia and with Indian mysticism and spirituality . In the new millennium neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating the sounds of the 60s like Tame Impala and The Essex Green .\n\nKULA SHAKER - Tattva (1996) \nKULA SHAKER - Hey Dude (1996)\nKULA SHAKER - Hush (1996)\n\n\n11.08. HARD ROCK \n\nHard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music. In the new commercial climate many glam metal bands like Europe, Ratt, White Lion and Cinderella broke up. Many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s, but they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s. Other bands such as MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands' commercial viability during the decade. Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith\n\n\n\n\n\n11.09. SOUL MUSIC \n\nAs disco and funk were dominating the charts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from soft rock and adult contemporary. Many funk bands, such as Con Funk Shun, Cameo, and Lakeside would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Teddy Pendergrass, Peabo Bryson, Atlantic Starr, and Larry Graham. After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as contemporary R&amp;B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style.\n\nBARRY WHITE - When Will I See You Again (1990)\nBARRY WHITE - Put Me In Your Mix (1991)\nBARRY WHITE - Practice What You Preach (1994)\nPERCY SLEDGE - WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN (1994)\nBARRY WHITE - Come On (1995 )\n\n\n11.10.

TRIP HOP &amp; POST TRIP HOP MUSIC\n\nTrip hop is a music genre consisting of downtempo electronic music which originated in the early 1990s in the UK, especially Bristol. Deriving from &quot;post&quot;-acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. Musically, trip hop contains a slow tempo and a hypnotic sound created by an electronic background and prominent string instrumentation. Several trip hop artists and bands, such as Massive Attack, Tricky, Portishead and Morcheeba have received attention and/or chart success, both on mainstream national charts and on the more dance and indie-based ones.\nAfter the success of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky albums in 1994 and 1995, a new generation of trip hop artists emerged with a more standardized sound. Notable &quot;post-trip-hop&quot; artists include Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto. They integrated trip hop with other genres ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including ambient, R&amp;B/soul, IDM, experimental industrial, atmospheric drum n bass/jungle, liquid dubstep, breakbeat, drum 'n' bass, acid jazz, and new age.\n\n\nMASSIVE ATTACK - Be Thankful for What You've Got (1991)\nMADINNA &amp; MASSIVE ATTACK - Want You (1995)\nMASSIVE ATTACK - Inertia Creeps (1998)\nTRICKY - Evolution Revolution Love (2001)\nMORCHEEBA Feat..Big Daddy Kane - What's Your Name (2003) \nMORCHEEBA - Wonders never cease (2005)\nMASSIVE ATTACK - Live With Me (Performance Version) (2006)\nMASSIVE ATTACK - Live With Me (second version) (2006)\nMASSIVE ATTACK - Safe From Harm ( 2006)\nPORTISHEAD - The Rip (2008)\nPORTISHEAD - Magic Doors (2008)\nGRACE JONES - Corporate Cannibal (2008)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ec0e28d30dcb82188ef28d72568d3e4e6164de","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ec0e28d30dcb82188ef28d72568d3e4e6164de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,236,14,40,211,13,203,130,24,142,242,141,114,86,141,62,78,97,100,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
