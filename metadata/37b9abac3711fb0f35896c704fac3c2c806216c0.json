He sings lead in a local hardcore band. He puts out zines, pseudo-revolutionary material, and flypost propaganda about town. It's good to be king. Or at least it is until Missy, Heavy's girlfriend, goes away for college. How can a guy like Heavy be expected to handle a long-distance romance? Short answer: He can't.\n\nMissy is out of sight and Heavy's mind is already drifting towards his next sexual conquest. A king can't be expected to live without a queen. But can he maintain his throne when Missy returns, reborn as a true NYC punk and pissed as all hell? Can Heavy survive a true group of hardcores invading his turf or will he just wind up Pounded?\n\nWritten by Brian Wood (Couscous Express, Channel Zero) and illustrated by Steve Rolston (Queen &amp; Country, Mek).\n\nThis torrent comes with an ADULT rating due to mature language and scenes of violence.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b9abac3711fb0f35896c704fac3c2c806216c0","amp;dn":"Pounded+TPB+%28Oni+Press%29+%5BADULT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b9abac3711fb0f35896c704fac3c2c806216c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,185,171,172,55,17,251,15,53,137,108,112,79,172,60,44,128,98,22,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
