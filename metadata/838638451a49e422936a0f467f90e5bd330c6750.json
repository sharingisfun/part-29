Explore, mine resources, craft tools and weapons, hunt, make traps and grow plants. Build a shelter to survive nights and share your worlds online. Ride horses or camels and herd cattle. Blast your way through the rock with explosives. Build complex electric devices. Possibilities are infinite in this sandbox survival and construction game.\n\nThis is the twenty third release of Survivalcraft, and it adds new survival mechanics, such as hunger and stamina! You can till soil and grow your own food from seeds. A large number of new animals have been introduced, such as orcas, zebras, lions, rhinos, and more. The animals now use pathfinding to locate their goals and prey. Boats allow you to visit remote islands far out in the ocean.\n\nSurvivalcraft brings features you love in the PC version of Minecraft to your mobile device: infinite worlds, caves, logic elements (electricity), weather, boats, and many more. It does so while maintaining its own realistic, survival-themed style.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWebsite: http://kaalus.wordpress.com\n\nWhat's New\n1.22 Changes\nAdded rakes, farming, seeds, rye, wild rye\nAdded flour, dough and bread\nMade bricks, granite, basalt paintable\nAdded hunger, stamina, sleep deprivation, drowning\nAdded rhinos, gnus, lions, ostriches, zebras, orcas\nBulls &amp; cows models updated\nMore overhangs and funky shapes of mountains\nAdded islands out in the ocean\nAdded boats\nAdded pathfinding\nMade creatures go after food\nCan cook eggs\nAdded vital stats panel\n...plus many more, see http://kaalus.wordpress.com/updates-history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:838638451a49e422936a0f467f90e5bd330c6750","amp;dn":"Survivalcraft+1.22.2.0+%5BAPK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"838638451a49e422936a0f467f90e5bd330c6750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,134,56,69,26,73,228,34,147,106,15,70,127,144,229,189,51,12,103,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
