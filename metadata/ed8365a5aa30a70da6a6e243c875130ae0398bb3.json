Reunited, the Rebels team up with a\n\ntribe of Ewoks to combat the Imperial forces on the forest moon of Endor.\n\nMeanwhile the Emperor and Darth Vader conspire to turn Luke to the dark\n\nside, and young Skywalker is determined to rekindle the spirit of the\n\nJedi within his father. The Galactic Civil War has never been more \n\noutrageous, as the Rebel forces gather to attack the seemingly\n\ndefenseless and incomplete second Death Star in the battle that will\n\ndetermine the fate of the galaxy.\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2744424473/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2744424473/&lt;/a&gt;  {Trailer}\n\n\nDirected by: Peter Shin\n\nWritten by:  Cherry Chevapravatdumrong - David A.
