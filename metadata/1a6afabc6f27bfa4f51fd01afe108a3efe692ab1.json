Theyve thrown down the gauntlet to send him around the globe \n to force him out of his comfort zone. Stephen wants the experience to broaden \n Karls mind and change his outlook on the world. Ricky wants Karl to hate every \n minute of it for his own amusement.\n\n Dispatched on what many would term a journey of a lifetime, the little \n Englander will be putting his misgivings to one side as Karl finds out for \n himself what the fuss is about. He will travel to the Great Wall of China, \n Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen \n Itza in Mexico, the Taj Mahal in India and the Great Pyramids of Egypt. \n Meanwhile Gervais and Merchant will be keeping a watchful eye from London, \n monitoring every step of Pilkingtons journey. The conclusion of the series will \n see the weary traveler returning home to report on his findings.\n\n Karl commented: I cant wait to get started. Not cos Im excited but cos the \n sooner we start the sooner it will be over. The fact the nurse gave me an \n injection that protects me from dirty chimps put a dampener on the whole thing. \n I dont think Ross Kemp has to have that injection.
