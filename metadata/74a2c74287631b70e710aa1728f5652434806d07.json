The husband is subsequently murdered by Pathan bandits while the two men are out on a reconnaissance mission in the Afghan mountains, in search of a local mullah warrior who has been organising armed resistance to British rule. Already greatly mistrusted and despised by his racist superiors, and now rejected by his former lover, Officer Case is court marshaled on a trumped up charge of cowardice in the face of the enemy, for not staying to rescue his fellow officer from the bloodlust of the Gilzhai tribesmen.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 688x288, 25.000 fps, 2007 Kbps, 01h18m14s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\n\nDVDRip, English audio, optional subtitles English, Greek, Romanian, Spanish\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fqv11nnht/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fqv11nnht/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/bf6fcngkx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/bf6fcngkx/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/tbqeeisoh/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/tbqeeisoh/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/617n53qup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/617n53qup/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/m3a6bhqk1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/m3a6bhqk1/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a2c74287631b70e710aa1728f5652434806d07","amp;dn":"The+Brigand+of+Kandahar+-+1965+%5BHammer+adventure%5D+multi+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a2c74287631b70e710aa1728f5652434806d07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,162,199,66,135,99,27,112,231,16,170,23,40,245,101,36,52,128,109,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
