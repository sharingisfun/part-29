Gavshon &amp; Drew Magratten \n\n Listen to them parrot the lie about how Mahmoud Ahmadinejad supposedly said he would &quot;Push the israelis into the sea&quot;, which is a complete fabrication from an Ayatollah Khomenei quote that Ahmadinejad repeated IN FARSI; THE TRANSLATOR LIED.\n\n The REAL quote is &quot;The zionist REGIME will vanish with the pages of time.&quot;\n\n  (That&amp;#039;s iT!)\n\n Multiply this repeated LiE by the number of TVs and you have TRILLIONS!=S\n  Check Bruce Springsteen - 57 Channels and Nothing&amp;#039;s On.\n\n Listen to the brainwashed israelis gloat about their murderous jets flying over auschwitz in a picture; people who WEREN&amp;#039;T EVEN BORN YET, nonetheless. \n\nSee how they train little girls to be murderers, flying cobra helicopters. \n\nSee how everyday israelis are brainwashed into having life dreams of being &amp;#039;special-forces&amp;#039; (cruel-assassins).\n\n Watch them talk nonchalant about firing missles at children!!!\n\n The only saving grace here is that the interviewer asks some of the right questions, and ONE israeli who actually says &quot;i hope there&amp;#039;s another way.&quot; \n(in reference to the bombing of IRAN: WWIII) \n\n The rest of them seem to be too stupid, braiwashed, cruel or scared to realise that an-attack-on-Iran=IS=WWIII.\n\n GTR5.com WakeUpFromYourSlumber.com Halaqah.com\n\n Be sure to check out Andrea Bocelli&amp;#039;s Statue Of Liberty Concerto July,2001(DiVX): available here on .torrent! ooh, the irony.\n\nPreview this video and the Bocelli Concerto on Google Video!
