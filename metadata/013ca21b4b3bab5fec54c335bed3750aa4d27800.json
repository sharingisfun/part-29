It is owned by Hearst Magazines, and is published monthly. The editorial offices are located in Newport Beach, California.\n\nRoad &amp; Track (often abbreviated R&amp;T) was founded by two friends, Wilfred H. Brehaut, Jr. and Joseph S. Fennessy, in 1947, in Hempstead, New York. Published only six times from 1947 to 1949, it struggled in its early years. By 1952, regular contributor and editor John Bond had become the owner of the magazine, which then grew until its sale to CBS Publications in 1972. In 1988, Hachette Filipacchi Media took ownership of the magazine. In October 2008, Matt DeLorenzo became Editor-in-Chief, succeeding Thos L. Bryant, who had been in place for 20 years. Hearst Magazines purchased the magazine in 2011. \n\n\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.roadandtrack.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.roadandtrack.com/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013ca21b4b3bab5fec54c335bed3750aa4d27800","amp;dn":"Road+%26amp%3B+Track+Magazine+Collection+PDF+MEGAPACK+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013ca21b4b3bab5fec54c335bed3750aa4d27800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,60,162,27,75,59,171,95,236,84,195,53,190,211,117,10,164,210,120,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
