Simon Says is the first album by American bubblegum pop group the 1910 Fruitgum Company on the Buddah Records label. Released in 1968, it included two songs that appeared on the Billboard Top 100, the most from any of the group's albums, although it was not their highest-charting album. \n\nIt's been debated whether or not the members of the band actually played on the album since the Ohio Express, another band put together by Super K Productions (headed by Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz), actually consisted of two groups: one that produced the records and another that toured and promoted the name. This is countered by original drummer Floyd Marcus, who has stated that all five men listed really were behind the instruments.\n\nThe album cover featured film strips from a photo shoot of the band members, a design that presumably inspired the cover of Swedish pop group Secret Service's 1979 single &quot;Oh Susie&quot;/&quot;Give Me Your Love.&quot;\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Says_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Says_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BABaKAAdB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BABaKAAdB&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 7700kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Media Length: 00:02:01\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
