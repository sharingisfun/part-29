The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s later albums retained a leftist politicization and intellectual lyrical style, while adopting a broader alternative rock sound, especially after the mysterious disappearance of lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards in 1995.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœForever DelayedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the ManicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ greatest hits album, released in 2002. The album includes three singles which never appeared on earlier albums (Ã¢â‚¬ËœMotown JunkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSuicide Is PainlessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Masses Against the ClassesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢). The latter is one of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two UK #1 hits, along with Ã¢â‚¬ËœIf You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be NextÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The album features two new songs as well: Ã¢â‚¬ËœThere by the Grace of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœDoor to the RiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n======================================\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 - A Design For Life.flac\nA2 - Motorcycle Emptiness.flac\nA3 - If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next.flac\nA4 - La Tristesse Durera (Scream To A Sigh).flac\nB1 - There By The Grace Of God.flac\nB2 - You Love Us.flac\nB3 - Australia.flac\nB4 - You Stole The Sun From My Heart.flac\nB5 - Kevin Carter.flac\nB6 - Tsunami.flac\nC1 - The Masses Against The Classes.flac\nC2 - From Despair To Where.flac\nC3 - Door To The River.flac\nC4 - Everything Must Go.flac\nC5 - Faster.flac\nD1 - Little Baby Nothing.flac\nD2 - Suicide Is Painless (Theme From Mash).flac\nD3 - So Why So Sad.flac\nD4 - The Everlasting.flac\nD5 - Motown Junk.flac\n\n============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 566 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Forever Delayed\nTrack name/Total                         : 20\nPerformer                                : Manic Street Preachers\nGenre                                    : Alt.
