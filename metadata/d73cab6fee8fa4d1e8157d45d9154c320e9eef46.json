Their 3D Binaural experience is striking and requires no special equipment besides stereo headphones. The Neumann KU100 dummy head was placed at listening position in the phenomenal 6.1 DTS mastering room. &quot;Jeff Levison the mastering engineer calibrated, pressed record, play and we left the room. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as close to hearing our DVD in 6.1 as it gets!&quot; The simplest ear-buds and a portable player can provide plenty of binaural thrills! The listener is placed in the performance with sounds localized in a 360-degree sphere. Most binaural recording today are done with an artificial or &quot;dummy&quot; head replicating the average human head in dimensions and details. Some of the recording heads also model the shoulders and may even have hair on the head, because all of these details have an effect on the sound picked up by the two mikes. These mikes are usually tiny omni directional condensers mounted in the entrance to the ear canals. - Find out more about Binaural by going to: www.binaural.com\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
