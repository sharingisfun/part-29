Glen\n\nPlot: Jamie Klein is an out-of-work butch lesbian actor willing to try almost anything for a role. Not being a traditionally feminine woman, Jamie dresses up for auditions as &quot;Femme Jamie,&quot; but has no success in landing roles. To add insult to injury, her roommate Lola&amp;#039;s cat (named Howard) is also an actor, and he gets cast in virtually anything he auditions for. After watching Howard&amp;#039;s acting reel, Jamie is ready to rise to the challenge and prove to herself that she can be more successful than a stupid cat. Jamie&amp;#039;s best friend David convinces her that the way to do this is to simply be yourself, which in Jamie&amp;#039;s case, is what she refers to as &quot;Butch Jamie&quot; -- short hair spiked up with gel, Doc Martin boots, a studded belt, and a neck chain. This unintentionally tips Jamie&amp;#039;s perceived gender in the opposite direction, and she gets offered a role in a film as a man - Steve. Offended by the reality that there is little room for butch women in show biz, Jamie is reluctant to take the role, but accepts. Under the producer&amp;#039;s requests, she is bound to confidentiality as Male Jamie and cannot reveal her true identity as a woman. On set, Jamie confronts a whole new set of hoops to jump through as a male imposter. &quot;He&quot; meets a flirtatious and alluring straight woman named Jill, and despite Jamie&amp;#039;s better judgement, the two begin a hilariously complicated and sexy affair.\n\n\n\n\nOMiNO\n\n1h 24mn\n624 x 336 (1.857:1)\n23.976 fps\n942 Kbps\nAC3, 192 Kbps \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1053818/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1053818/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEn subs included\n\nGot offers?\nDVDs, screeners, work at a dvd rental, got R5&amp;#039;s?\nWe accept donations :)\nmail us - domino (at) hush (dot) com\nGreetz - ALTRUiSM, D0PE, RENTAL, ARCHiVED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa957f8b7f51f11a2f154997b05e14308422eae","amp;dn":"Butch.Jamie.2007.DVDRip.XviD-DOMiNO%C3%82%C2%A9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa957f8b7f51f11a2f154997b05e14308422eae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,169,87,248,183,245,31,17,162,241,84,153,123,5,225,67,8,66,46,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
