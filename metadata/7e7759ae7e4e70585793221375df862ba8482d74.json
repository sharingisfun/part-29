Thomas puts us in the wagon with young Walt making the rounds with Doc Sherwood in Marceline, Missouri. He makes us feel Walt's despair at the loss of Oswald the Lucky Rabbitâ€”and Walt's jubilance not long after with the creation of Mickey Mouse.\r\n\r\nWe follow Walt to France during World War I, sit alongside him at the premiere of Snow White, and weather with him the dark days of World War II. We watch as orange groves give way to magic and pixie dust. Even if you've heard these stories before, Thomas brings themâ€”and many othersâ€”to vivid life, with wit and charm, and deepens your admiration for Walt Disney.\r\n\r\nBob Thomas wrote two biographies of Walt (and one of Walt's brother, Roy), and he counted the Disneys among his many Hollywood friends. Walt himself gave his future biographer a personal tour of Disneyland when the park was still under constructionâ€”driving Thomas to the site in a convertible! No other biographer writes of Walt Disney with such authority and authenticity.\r\n\r\nCOME ON, EVERYBODY, HERE WE GO!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e7759ae7e4e70585793221375df862ba8482d74","amp;dn":"Magician+of+the+Movies+-+The+Life+of+Walt+Disney+%282016%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e7759ae7e4e70585793221375df862ba8482d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,119,89,174,126,78,112,88,87,147,34,19,117,223,134,43,168,72,45,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
