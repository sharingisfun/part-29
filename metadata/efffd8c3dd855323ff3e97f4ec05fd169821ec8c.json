An introduction to operational and design principles, this book offers a review of heat and mass transfer theory relevant to performance, leading into and exploration of the use of heat pipes, particularly in high-heat flux applications and in situations in which there is any combination of non-uniform heat loading, limited airflow over the heat generating components, and space or weight constraints. Key implementation challenges are tackled, including load-balancing, materials characteristics, operating temperature ranges, thermal resistance, and operating orientation.\r\n\r\nWith its presentation of mathematical models to calculate heat transfer limitations and temperature gradient of both high- and low-temperature heat pipes, the book compares calculated results with the available experimental data. It also includes a series of computer programs developed by the author to support presented data, aid design, and predict performance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efffd8c3dd855323ff3e97f4ec05fd169821ec8c","amp;dn":"Heat+Pipe+Design+and+Technology+2nd+ed+-+Bahman+Zohuri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efffd8c3dd855323ff3e97f4ec05fd169821ec8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,255,216,195,221,133,83,35,255,62,151,244,236,5,253,22,152,33,236,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
