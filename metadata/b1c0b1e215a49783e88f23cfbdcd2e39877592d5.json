It is a pledge to you our customers to always seek out the best process, the best equipment, to strive for that â€˜Holy Grailâ€™ of audio reproduction: transparency, realism, sound staging and dynamic range in order to bring the listener to as close as possible to the original performance. At Pope Music we strive for the â€˜Goosefleshâ€™ effect. It is a never ending quest that will constantly change and evolve with the state-of-the-art.â€\r\n\r\nThese disks are all recorded with two B&amp;K Omnidirectional microphones using Mark Levinson designed Cello custom microphone preamplifiers, Apogee AD1000 A/D converter, a Nagra D 4-track open reel recorder and Cello Strings cabling.
