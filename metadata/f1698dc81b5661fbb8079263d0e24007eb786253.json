Yehudi Menuhin has created this expansive survey of musical traditions from five continents. With panoramic vision and infectious enthusiasm, he takes us from primeval rhythms of Africa to the symphonies of Beethoven, from plainsong to jazz, from Swiss yodeling to Irish jig, from steel drum to electronic synthesizer.\nThe Music of Man was a series of eight hour-long specials with host Yehudi Menuhin, following the development of music from its beginnings at the dawn of history to the electronic experiments, jazz and rock of our own time. Menuhin, the renowned violinist, conductor and humanist, participated both as violin soloist and conductor throughout the series, and was also co-writer. Filmed in locations around the world, The Music of Man was produced in English and in French. Composers ranged from improvising African tribesmen, Canadian Indians and Southern revivalists to Perotinus, Machaut, Gabrieli, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Debussy and Bartok. Many famous artists from around the world participated, among them sitarist Ravi Shankar, violinist Jean Carignan, jazz pianist Oscar Peterson, contralto Maureen Forrester, composers Aaron Copland and Murray Schafer, and pianist and musicologist Glenn Gould. The films took five years to make, required two separate camera teams which travelled to 500 locations, and amassed more than 165 km of film.\n\nWriters: Yehudi Menuhin, Curtis W. Davis, and Charles Weir.\nProducers: Curtis W. Davis, Richard Bocking and John Thomson\nCo-produced by CBC, the Ontario Educational Communications Authority, and the Mississippi Authority for Educational Television.\n\n\n1)  The Quiver of Life \nThe first program tells how music began 35,000 years ago with hollowed-out animal bones. In India and China, music was a perfected art long before the birth of Christ. In the western world, music has only flowered in the past thousand years. Menuhin points to the basis of musical expression: man's sense of rhythm, first developed in the womb in response to the mother's heartbeat. Performing are Menuhin, Canadian composer Murray Schafer, jazz flutist Paul Horn, native singers and dancers from New Guinea, Senegal and Plains Cree Indians, Ukone of the Gwi people, Martha Takata of Syria, Abed Azrie, Nellie Karras Dancers, Greek singer Arda Mondikan, Ponti and Demotic Dancers of Greece.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/9805/rqug.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/9805/rqug.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/3667/ymt9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/3667/ymt9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/7827/bsn4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/7827/bsn4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/6645/jurb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/6645/jurb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/4910/2va1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/4910/2va1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1499/mm9b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1499/mm9b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/1664/dp8u.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/1664/dp8u.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/2814/8p8n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/2814/8p8n.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/9643/6yet.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/9643/6yet.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/531/qpru.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/531/qpru.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/4738/z50l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/4738/z50l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3972/bgqb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3972/bgqb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/6606/1jdw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/6606/1jdw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/8706/fyfg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/8706/fyfg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1135/xpzi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1135/xpzi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/4928/t2ji.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/4928/t2ji.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1899 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x544\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.324:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 57:31.240\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 890 MB\nSource: VHS\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Music_of_Man&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Music_of_Man&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1698dc81b5661fbb8079263d0e24007eb786253","amp;dn":"CBC+The+Music+of+Man+1of8+The+Quiver+of+Life+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1698dc81b5661fbb8079263d0e24007eb786253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,105,141,200,27,86,97,251,184,7,146,99,208,226,64,7,235,120,98,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
