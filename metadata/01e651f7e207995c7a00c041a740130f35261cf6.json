The band had spent time touring after their debut album Tons of Sobs the previous year, and there is a marked difference in the musicianship of the band as well as Paul Rodgers's voice. Whereas Tons of Sobs had been produced by Guy Stevens, Free was produced by the head of Island Records, Chris Blackwell.\n\nThis album saw the burgeoning of the songwriting partnership between Paul Rodgers and bassist Andy Fraser, which had been glimpsed on Tons of Sobs with songs such as &quot;I'm a Mover&quot;; here, eight out of the nine tracks bear a Fraser/Rodgers credit. Possibly as a result of the sixteen year-old Fraser's influence as a songwriter the bass guitar is far more prominent here than on the previous album. The instrument is used as a rhythm guitar, driving the songs, while Kossoff's lead guitar develops from it.\n\nWhile Fraser and Rodgers made a strong writing partnership, tensions in the band increased. Kossoff, whose natural spontaneity had been given free rein up to then, particularly resented being taught very specific rhythm guitar parts by Fraser. However, Blackwell managed to keep the band in line to record the album.\n\nHowever, the album performed fairly poorly on release, only reaching No. 22 in the UK charts and failing completely in the US. The single releases, &quot;Broad Daylight&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Creepin'&quot;, also failed. Two songs from the album, &quot;I'll Be Creepin'&quot; and &quot;Woman&quot;, were later covered by the American rock band Three Dog Night.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;I'll Be Creepin'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:27\n    &quot;Songs of Yesterday&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n    &quot;Lying in the Sunshine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:51\n    &quot;Trouble on Double Time&quot; (Fraser, Rodgers, Simon Kirke, Paul Kossoff) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23\n    &quot;Mouthful of Grass&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n    &quot;Woman&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n    &quot;Free Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:24\n    &quot;Broad Daylight&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n    &quot;Mourning Sad Morning&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:04\n\nBonus Tracks\n\n    &quot;Broad Daylight&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.09\n       \n    &quot;The Worm&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.03\n       \n    &quot;I'll Be Creeping&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2.47\n       \n    &quot;Sugar for Mr. Morrison&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.01\n       \n    &quot;Broad Daylight&quot; (BBC Session) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.21\n       \n    &quot;Songs of Yesterday&quot; (BBC Session) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.11\n        \n    &quot;Mouthful of Grass&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.33\n       \n    &quot;Woman&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4.00\n       \n    &quot;Trouble on Double Time&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2.37\n        \n    &quot;Mourning Sad Morning&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5.10\n\n        \nFree:\n\n    Paul Rodgers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Paul Kossoff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar\n    Andy Fraser Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Simon Kirke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01e651f7e207995c7a00c041a740130f35261cf6","amp;dn":"Free+-+Free+%5BRemaster-Expanded%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01e651f7e207995c7a00c041a740130f35261cf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,230,81,247,226,7,153,92,122,0,192,65,167,64,19,15,53,38,28,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
