Recorded at\nOberlin Conservatory, this densely-packed and highly satisfying performance\nfollows the release of a solo recital, also on MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ma and carries forward in a\nsimilar vein with some marked departures. Chief among them is her crew of\nassembled accompanists. Bassist Kenny Davis competes a bit with the cavernous\nacoustics of the concert hall and there are moments during the more stentorian\nensemble passages where his strings endure compromised audibility though\nfortunately his solo passages suffer no such hindrances. Conversely, drummer\nKassa Overall has no problem being heard, his aggressive percussive patterns\nregularly matching AllenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in terms of momentum and volume.\n\nThe inspired ensemble wildcard is tap dancer Maurice Chestnut, conscripted in\npart to contribute and embody the projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s focus on honoring African American\ndance traditions as well as those of the music realm. Allen name checks a good\ndozen luminaries in either artistic arena as sources of inspiration among them\nthe likes of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBojanglesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Robinson, Ornette Coleman, Gregory Hines and Betty\nCarter. None explicitly manifest in the music, but Allen makes other referents\nabundantly clear in her set list choices. A lengthy contrafact of her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe\nWestern WallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Mal WaldronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoul EyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ spools out over nearly a third of an\nhour. Later itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a suturing of GershwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEmbraceable YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Billie HolidayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nsignature ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLovermanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, each filtered through AllenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s grandly rhapsodic lens.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPhilly JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ echoes its namesake in the opening snare shot from Overall. Much of\nthe pieceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second half gives over to a dialogue between the drummer and the\nclickety-clacking tap play of Chestnut and the pair very nearly wears out their\nwelcome. The two paired-tune medleys follow broken by the shorter interstitial\npieces ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFour By FiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by McCoy Tyner and the original ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLWBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s HouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. On both\nChestnut once again asserts himself, his steel-heeled syncopations blending\nnimbly with OverallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stampeding kit constructions. Like Davis, there are\nmoments where he has step lively to compete with the pounding surf generated by\nthe drums, but more often than not ably holds his own.\n\nAllen directs the action like a matriarch at an extended family picnic,\nmarshalling each piece and each of her sidemen for maximum potential. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a by\nturns exhilarating and exhausting journey, but audience rewards far outweigh\nexpenditures in the final tally. Passionate and magnanimous in her musical\nexplorations, Allen wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have it any other way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02608c25eedc8b6fe8d39a3773eca2432142d13a","amp;dn":"Geri+Allen+%26+Time+Line+-+Live%21+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02608c25eedc8b6fe8d39a3773eca2432142d13a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,96,140,37,238,220,139,111,232,211,154,55,115,236,162,67,33,66,209,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
