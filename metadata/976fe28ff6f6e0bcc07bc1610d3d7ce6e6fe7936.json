This collection isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t complete, but it is what we have been able to assemble \n\nfor you. \n\nMay the Vril force be with you!\n\nSECRETS OF COLD WAR TECHNOLOGY\n\nLOST SCIENCE\n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM I - WHITE RAY CONDUCTORS \n\nAn astounding assortment of arcane designs and remarkable inventions is presented in the first volume. Aerial batteries were designs which made practical use of the energies which celestial currents and rays brought to earth. Patents of Ward, Vion, Palenscar and others. Earth currents and earth resonance are discussed extensively in this volume. \n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM II - VRIL TELEGRAPHY \n\nTelegraphy began with a truly radionic basis. Maps show that the telegraph system was literally generated along VRIL paths as railroad personnel followed their own intuitions while laying track. \n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM III - VRIL LINKAGE\n\nThe manner in which VRIL radiance has been apprehended through Ã¢â‚¬Å“aquavideoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, photographs, and photochemical means is thoroughly documented here in remarkable depth. Introducing telegraphic patents which made direct use of ancient geomantic means for communicating intent: non-electric pendulum telegraph systems, and VRIL impression recording systems. \n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM IV - VRIL ARCHEFORMS\n\nA remarkable assortment of earth battery patents. A primer course in VRIL genesis of metal lodes and placer deposits is found here. How ancient architecture managed to accumulate, intercept, and modulate VRIL was only the first step of a science which has yet to reach its perfection. The use of radionic tuners (made to entune VRIL and raise virtual structures) is discussed throughout this section of photographs and illustrations.\n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM V - VRIL CONNECTION\n\nThe discovery of nerve-induction telephony by Antonio Meucci in 1849 marked the true birth of telephony. In these documents, patents, and articles we read of developments whereby deaf persons could hear directly through the nerveworks of the body. These early attempts to approach true empathic transmission are the basis of systems which Tesla would later advance to a wary scientific public. \n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM VI - VRIL TELEPHONY \n\nA presentation of nearly every pertinent VRIL transducer of which telephony was comprised. How the human aura and its VRIL threads dendritically merge with the natural VRIL is the central theme here. Every kind of transducer is shown. Presents systems which intensified the VRIL content of telephone lines with no need for electrical power! \n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM VII - VRIL DENDRITIC GROUND SYSTEMS \n\nA presentation on the earliest unknown wireless researchers: Mahlon Loomis, Nathan Stubblefield, &amp; Dr. Amos Dolbear. This volume chronicles the discovery of natural VRIL power in the earth ... usable power for communications of signal, word, &amp; intent.\n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM VIII - VRIL AND GROUND RADIO\n\nThe early trans-aqueous systems of Steinheil (1838) and others. Complete patent collections: ground signalling systems of J. Murgas, Tesla, Rogers, etc. Static-free reception for shortwave afficionadi! Forgotten commercial underground antennas. Magnified radio transmission through geological formations. \n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM IX - VRIL AND AERIAL RADIO\n\nAerials not Antennas. Learn the relationship between electro-impulses and VRIL currents. Capacitative systems of enormous size and anomalous operation. Space rays and Ground rays meeting in transmitter components. VLF waveguides, valleys as radio-chutes. Oil-filled tanks as VLF radiators. Electrical architecture and VRIL articulations. Bent-L, Split-T, Split-Y and other huge systems. Tesla, Fessenden, Lodge, Conrad, Butcher, Alexanderson, Squier, Thompson, Hughes, Fortesque, and many now-unknown designers.\n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM X - VRIL AND ELECTRIC RAY PROJECTORS\nAnomalous radiant phenomena. Visual and infrared photophones and radiophony. Rays and VRIL propagation through space! The original, forgotten, and unquoted Tesla paper (1892) describing radiant electric rays. Teslian Ã¢â‚¬Å“light-like raysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½! Tesla multi-component detecting system employing Selenium. Heittinger and the aerial skybeam power transmitters. Each working radio aerial system impossible to comprehend or rationalize from ordinary radio convention. Black radiance between white electroshocks. McCullough directive detecting tubes (related in operation to Moray listening detectors), UliviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strange explosive ray, Grindell-Matthews and his now-secret beam projectors, and many more.\n\nVRIL COMPENDIUM XI - VRIL AND ELF DEVICES\nDangerous VRIL magnifications by electrical impulses. ELF and Project Sanguine articles. Modifying human behavior by ELF brainwave entrainment. HAARP Project patents! Includes large radio power installations of the early RadioAge. Impulse Power Generators of Shoemaker, Reisz, Vreeland, Farnsworth, Chubb, Piggot, and more. Rare period photographs and articles. Huge plasma arc oscillators of Lesh, Fritz Lowenstein (Tesla's assistant), and Valdemar Poulsen. A complete research thesis!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:976fe28ff6f6e0bcc07bc1610d3d7ce6e6fe7936","amp;dn":"Vril+Compendium+Complete+VOL+I+-+XI+-+Gerry+Vassilatos+%28Lost+Sci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"976fe28ff6f6e0bcc07bc1610d3d7ce6e6fe7936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,111,226,143,246,246,224,188,192,123,193,97,13,61,124,230,230,254,121,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
