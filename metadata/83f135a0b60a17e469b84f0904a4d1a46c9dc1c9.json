A. Salvatore - Charon's Claw [2012]\n\nOverview\nIn the 3rd book of the #4 New York Times best-selling Neverwinter Saga, Drizzt draws his swords once more to aid his friends. His lover, Dahlia SinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢felle, can speak of nothing but the moment she will face the Netherese lord Herzgo Alegni once again. Drizzt has already followed a trail of vengeance beside Dahlia. Can he justify one more battle to settle a grudge he does not understand? Artemis Entreri too seeks vengeance. He offers to aid Dahlia in her mission to destroy Alegni. But CharonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Claw, AlegniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sentient sword, dominates EntreriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s movementsÃ¢â‚¬â€if not his mind. And then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the way Entreri looks at Dahlia. Can Drizzt trust his old foe?\n \nPraise for the Neverwinter Saga:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Emotional, respectful of its characters, intelligently written and structured, and finally summons a sense of nostalgic sorrow throughoutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œFantasy Book Review on Gauntlgrym, Neverwinter Saga Book I\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Full of excitement. Salvatore has mastered the art of showing a beautiful fight scene, and he is at the top of his game in this one. We meet many characters with many different fighting styles, and Salvatore does a great job of distinguishing between them. He manages to take these scenes from so much more than just a fight scene, to an integral part of the story.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The SFF Hub on Gauntlgrym, Neverwinter Saga Book I\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A quick read with some very satisfying fight scenes. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also deeply layered with emotional atmosphereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€California Literary Review on Gauntlgrym, Neverwinter Saga Book I\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/charons-claw-ra-salvatore/1107957504?ean=9780786963621&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/charons-claw-ra-salvatore/1107957504?ean=9780786963621&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f135a0b60a17e469b84f0904a4d1a46c9dc1c9","amp;dn":"R.+A.+Salvatore+-+Charon%27s+Claw+%5B2012%5D+Neverwinter+Saga+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f135a0b60a17e469b84f0904a4d1a46c9dc1c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,241,53,160,182,10,23,228,105,184,79,9,4,164,209,164,108,157,193,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
