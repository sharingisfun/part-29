Forming an active link in a chain that reaches back through Ovid's METAMORPHOSES directly to Homer, Roberto Calasso's re-exploration of the fantastic fables and mysteries we may only think we know explodes the entire world of Greek mythology, pieces it back together, and presents it to us in a new, and astonishing, and utterly contemporary way.\n\n&quot;I have no idea whether or not Roberto Calasso is a 'genius' but I do know that The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony is a perfect work like no other. He has re-created, in a blaze of light, the morning of our world: the gods, heroes, monsters of the Greeks are made mysterious sense of in what is, finally, a numinous text to be placed beside -- ahead of? -- Old and New Testaments.&quot; -- Gore Vidal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148001a248bd133e08b725123c27975679f04bf1","amp;dn":"Roberto+Calasso+-+The+Marriage+of+Cadmus+and+Harmony+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148001a248bd133e08b725123c27975679f04bf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,128,1,162,72,189,19,62,8,183,37,18,60,39,151,86,121,240,75,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
