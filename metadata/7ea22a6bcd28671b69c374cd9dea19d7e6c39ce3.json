As it turns out, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in protest to his lord raping and killing a girl and her samurai husband. This scandal is quickly covered up as the Akashi lord happens to be the ShogunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s younger brother. What makes matters worse is that this reckless scoundrel will be soon appointed to a higher political position which could prove to be detrimental for the entire Shogunate. In response to that, a plot is hatched: 13 assassins will undertake the suicide mission to murder him on his way back from Edo.\n\nThe movie can be roughly split in two parts. The first hour is purely character-driven, in a anti-establishment style that resembles Masaki Kobayashi and his masterful work in Seppuku and Samurai Rebellion. The last half hour is totally action-oriented as we see the Akashi clan entourage being trapped in a village and fighting to protect their lord, at which point one could be forgiven for thinking Seven Samurai and Akira Kurosawa. \n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Jusan.nin.No.Shikaku.1963.DVDRip.AVC.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 049 Kbps\nLength            : 1.73 GiB for 2h 0mn 36s 992ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 438 ~~ &gt; 1024 x 438 (2.338) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : ja\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057212/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057212/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, French, Portuguese\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea22a6bcd28671b69c374cd9dea19d7e6c39ce3","amp;dn":"Jusan.nin.No.Shikaku.1963.DVDRip.AVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea22a6bcd28671b69c374cd9dea19d7e6c39ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,162,42,107,205,40,103,27,105,195,116,205,157,234,25,215,230,195,156,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
