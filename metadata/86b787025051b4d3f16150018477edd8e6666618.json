Romance novelist by night.\nBritish single father.\nSomeone else is writing this love story...\n\nBlair Walton isn't your average curvaceous tattooed children's librarian. She's also one half of bestselling romance author, Scarlet Rose. Along with her BFF Raine, she spends her nights writing books so steamy, she's afraid they would shock her Southern conservative grandmother to death . . . if she knew about them. That's why she and Raine write in secret.\n\nOn deadline for their latest book and out of ideas, Raine suggests (demands) that Blair find a guy and &quot;do some research&quot;. Declan Bennet has all the qualifications: He's British, looks fabulous in a suit, has glorious blue eyes and gets bonus points for being an amazing single dad to his adorable son, Drake. But what starts out as a research project quickly turns into something much more. And Blair's not the only one with secrets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b787025051b4d3f16150018477edd8e6666618","amp;dn":"UnWritten+-+Chelsea+M.+Cameron","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b787025051b4d3f16150018477edd8e6666618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,183,135,2,80,81,180,211,241,97,80,1,132,119,237,216,230,102,102,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
