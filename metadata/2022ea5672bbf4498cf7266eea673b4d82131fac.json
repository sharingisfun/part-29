Surviving but with no memory, he is given a name: Jason Bourne. Physically and mentally agile, he retraces his past through a harrowing personal labyrinth. The discovery: He was a trained killer, and now in turn is being hunted by assassins.\n\n&quot;His characters are complex and credible, his sleight of plot as cunning as any terrorist conspiracy.
