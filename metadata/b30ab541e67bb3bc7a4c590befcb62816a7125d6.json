With the \nworld&amp;#039;s leading experts, he has made a personal study of the impact \nthat humans are having on the natural world and asked how the \nsituation could be reversed. The series investigates the main \ncauses of damage to the planet and how we can help to prevent them.\n\n\nIs there a crisis?\n------------------\nThe most striking feature of planet Earth is the existence of life, \nand the most striking feature of life is its richness and variety. \nFrom the depths of the oceans to the tops of rainforest canopies, \nfrom the African savannahs to the soil under our feet, David \nAttenborough revealed to us the extent of this living bounty. The \nlatest research show that this variety of life is threatened with \ndestruction by human activities. Will we destroy, as is being \npredicted, up to 50% of all species on the planet in this present \ncentury, and will that tragedy really matter to us, or our children \nand grandchildren? \n\n\n\nWhy is there a crisis?\n----------------------\nExtinction is a natural process, and five times in the history of \nlife it has happened on a huge scale. The dinosaurs were wiped out \nby a massive meteor strike that also killed off much of life on \nEarth. Human activities are beginning to cause a present day \nmass-extinction that is happening at unprecedented speed. How can we \nprevent this from happening? David Attenborough investigated which \nhuman activities are the most damaging to the natural world, in an \nattempt to understand how we can prevent this crisis from unfolding. \n\n\n\nThe future of life.\n-------------------\nHow the human species treats the planet over the next one hundred \nyears will determine the future of all life on Earth. We stand to \nlose up to 50% per cent of species on the planet if we continue using \nglobal resources at the current rate. At this crucial point in human \nhistory we can still choose whether future generations inhabit a \nhealthy, diverse planet, or a seriously impoverished one. In the final \nfilm of this trilogy, David Attenborough looked for hope and solutions.\n\nHELP SEED!\n\nMore related stuff: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b30ab541e67bb3bc7a4c590befcb62816a7125d6","amp;dn":"State.Of.The.Planet.2000.PAL.DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b30ab541e67bb3bc7a4c590befcb62816a7125d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,10,181,65,230,123,179,188,122,76,89,11,239,203,98,129,106,113,37,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
