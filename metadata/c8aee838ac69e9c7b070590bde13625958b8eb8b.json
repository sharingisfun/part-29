In 2004, Trading Yesterday released a demo CD titled The Beauty and the Tragedy, and after signing with Epic Records later that year, they released their first single, &quot;One Day&quot;, in the summer of 2005. They later left Epic and as of 2007 remain independent. Due to this, their full length album debut, to be titled More Than This, was shelved and was never officially released.\n\nThe band has since changed its name to The Age of Information and is currently working on an album after releasing an EP entitled Everything is Broken in September 2007.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8aee838ac69e9c7b070590bde13625958b8eb8b","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Information+-+Everything+Is+Broken%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8aee838ac69e9c7b070590bde13625958b8eb8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,174,232,56,172,105,233,199,176,112,89,11,222,19,98,89,88,184,235,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
