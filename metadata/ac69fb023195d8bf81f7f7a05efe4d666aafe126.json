Now it's up to Officer Dana Cypress to deal with the media scrutiny, religious zealots, and government quarantine that has come with them. In a town where the living have to learn to deal with those who are supposed to be dead, Officer Cypress must solve a brutal murder, and everyone, alive or undead, is a suspect. A beautiful 'farm noir' that puts a new twist on the zombie genre, created by NY Times Bestselling author Tim Seeley and Eisner nominated artist Mike Norton.\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru, theProletariat, and the Chairmen for this release.\n\nRevival #6: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8183616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8183616&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRevival #7: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8297118&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8297118&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac69fb023195d8bf81f7f7a05efe4d666aafe126","amp;dn":"Revival+1-5+%282012%29+%281440px%2B2048px-HD%29+%28Tarutaru-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac69fb023195d8bf81f7f7a05efe4d666aafe126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,105,251,2,49,149,216,191,129,247,247,160,94,254,77,102,106,175,225,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
