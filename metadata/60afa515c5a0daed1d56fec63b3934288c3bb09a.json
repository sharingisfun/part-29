He briefly hosted for MTV, released a few solo records and played some well-received solo-acoustic tours of the U.S. with former bandmate Malcolm Treece.\n\nNow, after a few years of successful reunion shows across the pond, Miles and Malc have officially reformed The Wonder Stuff with two new members, bassist Mark McCarthy and drummer Luke Johnson. The U.S. release of the group's fifth album, &amp;quot;Escape from Rubbish Island,&amp;quot; is set for March 22. A six-week North American tour--the band's first in more than 10 years--is also planned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60afa515c5a0daed1d56fec63b3934288c3bb09a","amp;dn":"The+Wonder+Stuff+-+Hup+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60afa515c5a0daed1d56fec63b3934288c3bb09a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,175,165,21,197,160,218,237,29,86,254,198,59,57,52,40,140,59,176,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
