Its wistful, bleak lyrics on separation are built on a driving rhythm backed by a heavy Wall of Sound-styled layer of synthesizer padding.\n\nIn contrast to the band's 1982 hit &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot;, which was largely a United States and Australian hit, &quot;Wishing&quot; song peaked strongly in Great Britain, Ireland and in Canada where it reached the Top 10, but only reached #26 on the U.S. Billboard charts in summer 1983.\n\nIn a celebration of early electronic music, digital radio station BBC 6 Music compiled a chart of its listeners' favourite synthesizer riffs in November 2006. &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)&quot; came second in the list to the Tubeway Army single &quot;Are 'Friends' Electric?&quot;.\n\nThe song holds the rare distinction of having been performed almost entirely on the black keys of a keyboard. In addition, the original version of this song clocked in at nearly 14 minutes.\n\nAlong with &quot;Telecommunication&quot; song, Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You) earned the praise of legendary producer Phil Spector, who, while emerging from seclusion in the 1980s to produce an album by The Ramones, called the track &quot;breathtaking&quot; and expressed interest in producing A Flock of Seagulls.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishing_(If_I_Had_a_Photograph_of_You)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishing_(If_I_Had_a_Photograph_of_You)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naBMdaADh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naBMdaADh&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:04:13\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
