It stars Viva Seifert, actress and one half of the band Joe Gideon and the Shark.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nHer Story sits you in front of a mothballed desktop computer and logs you into a police database. Search through hundreds of video clips that cover seven interviews from 1994 in which a British woman is interviewed about her missing husband. \n\nExplore the database by typing search terms, watch the clips where she speaks those words and piece together her story.\n\nUnlike anything you've played before, Her Story is an involving and moving experience. One that asks you to listen.\n\nMore Info:\n \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MrSamBarlow.HerStoryGame\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Copy 'com.MrSamBarlow.HerStoryGame' folder to 'sdcard/Android/obb'\n2.Install APK\n3.Launch the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1770e195ba33d67004374c2f1a86b58bdcfbc84","amp;dn":"Her+Story+v1.2.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1770e195ba33d67004374c2f1a86b58bdcfbc84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,119,14,25,91,163,61,103,0,67,116,194,241,168,107,88,189,207,188,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
