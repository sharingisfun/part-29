Either the left or right track was selected (based on quality) for the mono master.  Normalization was applied. Variable bit MP3 encoding was done for maximum quality with minimum file size.\n\nBugs:\nVariable bit MP3 files can sometimes report incorrect track times on early model-version players.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce29e2ac0831cf542fc3ad1a31f461a4d6389a58","amp;dn":"Marion+Zimmer+Bradley+-+The+Forest+House+Unabridged+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce29e2ac0831cf542fc3ad1a31f461a4d6389a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,41,226,172,8,49,207,84,47,195,173,26,49,244,97,164,214,56,154,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
