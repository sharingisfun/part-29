A very good show, although Robert's voice alternates between sounding great and being really irritating. Linda Lovelace, a well-known Deep Throat star introduced the show. No Quarter is simply amazing, one of the best versions I have ever heard, and Dazed And Confused has some really great moments in the middle. It is also the longest version of this song, clocks at 46 minutes! This is the third out of three times Since I've Been Loving You was played in 1975. The guitar solo in Stairway To Heaven is amazing, and the Theremin section of Whole Lotta Love has some excellent bass and drum interplay while Robert screams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbe6f297d34201e422a79c81c0a1b72fa4347606","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.27+Los+Angeles%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbe6f297d34201e422a79c81c0a1b72fa4347606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,230,242,151,211,66,1,228,34,167,156,129,192,161,183,47,164,52,118,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
