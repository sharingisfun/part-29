Sunnyland Slim's swinging New York rhythm section has no trouble following his bedrock piano, and the estimable King Curtis peels off diamond-hard tenor sax solos in the great Texas tradition that also mesh seamlessly. Slim runs through his standards -- &quot;The Devil Is a Busy Man,&quot; &quot;Shake It,&quot; &quot;It's You Baby&quot; -- in gorgeous stereo, and two unissued bonus cuts (including another of his best-known tunes, &quot;Everytime I Get to Drinking&quot;) make the CD reissue of Slim's Shout even more appealing.\n\n# This is a great CD- you can sit and really listen or you can just play it in the background and it will draw your attention back to it. It's lively music and great songs. Sunnyland's piano shines even when accompanied by an organ! The brass is good and the beat really drives forward. It makes me wish I could've seen them recording these songs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bba258d43fa0aa5aa4617058b0f6595aa1ce6ec1","amp;dn":"Sunnyland+Slim+-+Slim%27s+Shout+%281960%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%7BPrestige+Bluesville","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bba258d43fa0aa5aa4617058b0f6595aa1ce6ec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,162,88,212,63,160,170,90,164,97,112,88,176,246,89,90,161,206,110,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
