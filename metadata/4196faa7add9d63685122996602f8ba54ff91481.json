They were African-American men who, due to their light skin color, could &quot;pass&quot; among the white folks. They called this dangerous assignment going &quot;incognegro.&quot;\n\nZane Pinchback, a reporter for the New York-based New Holland Herald barely escapes with his life after his latest &quot;incognegro&quot; story goes bad. But when he returns to the sanctuary of Harlem, he&amp;#039;s sent to investigate the arrest of his own brother, charged with the brutal murder of a white woman in Mississippi.\n\nWith a lynch mob already swarming, Zane must stay &quot;incognegro&quot; long enough to uncover the truth behind the murder in order to save his brother ? and himself. He finds that the answers are buried beneath layers of shifting identities, forbidden passions and secrets that run far deeper than skin color.[/quote]\n\n\nBIG thanks to even steven!\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
