But instead of curing him, it triggers a powerful &quot;out-of-body&quot; experience and enables the patient - a depraved and dangerous loner - to inhabit other people's bodies and, through them, take revenge on the bullying medical students who were accidentally responsible for his condition. The doctor, who was herself a part of this group, is also targeted and as her colleagues are singled out and relentlessly picked off, she realises that she can trust no-one - friend or stranger - as this comatose killer moves in and out of bodies at will, getting ever closer as his murderous supernatural powers increase.&quot; (imdb)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd179424e7540e4501b701b854427c96f9aa7b47","amp;dn":"Red+Mist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd179424e7540e4501b701b854427c96f9aa7b47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,23,148,36,231,84,14,69,1,183,1,184,84,66,124,150,249,170,123,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
