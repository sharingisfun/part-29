More and more developers are turning to Clojure for its simplicity, performance benefits, concurrency features, and immutable data structures. Plus, like other Lisp-based languages, Clojure is easy to learn and super concise. This tutorial is designed to get developers who are new to Clojure quickly up and running with the language and toolset.\r\n\r\nArthur Ulfeldt covers the Leiningen build tool and setting up Clojure to work with the IntelliJ IDEA dev environment. He then reviews the basics of the syntax, including functions, expressions, values, macros, strings, and conditionals. He shows how to structure, compile, and deploy Clojure projects in Leiningen, and pull from Clojure's core library. In the final chapters, Arthur explores references and namespaces and points to resources to learn more about Clojure.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\nInstalling Leiningen\r\nConfiguring IntelliJ IDEA\r\nUsing REPLs to execute code\r\nWorking with simple and composite values\r\nMastering Clojure macros\r\nExploring Clojure syntax\r\nBuilding a Clojure project with Leiningen\r\nMapping, filtering, and reducing\r\nBinding and destructuring data\r\nWorking with identities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8579f4aa4fe3663ac017dabba614cb0d4ccc4136","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+Clojure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8579f4aa4fe3663ac017dabba614cb0d4ccc4136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,121,244,170,79,227,102,58,192,23,218,187,166,20,203,13,76,204,65,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
