This is like the plceholder, but reserved to always play sonic riders. I've confirmed this to work with Rebug 4.21 and 4.30\n\nComes with instructions to know how to properly install.\n\nThis one has artwork on the xmb screen when you go over the game. I was being lazy and forgot to change it in the other one :D\n\nSo download this one instead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ddc7568d58ae1e57c5ce545a85d3b4783f057d4","amp;dn":"Sonic+Riders+-+Custom+PKG+file+for+PS3+%28PS2+Classics%29+4.21%2B+%5BREV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ddc7568d58ae1e57c5ce545a85d3b4783f057d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,220,117,104,213,138,225,229,124,92,229,69,168,93,59,71,131,240,87,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
