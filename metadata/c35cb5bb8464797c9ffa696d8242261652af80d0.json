What she and her parents do not know is that Kovu is the son of Zira - a banished follower of the now-dead Scar. She plans to raise Kovu to overthrow Simba and become the king of the Pride Lands. This tests not only Kiara and Kovu's relationship as they mature, but Simba's relationship with his daughter.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lion King 1 1/2 (2004) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318403/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318403/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    [Movie Title ].........[ The Lion King 1 1/2\n    [Release Year ]........[ 2004\n    [iMDb Rating ].........[ 6.4/10\n    [Genre ]...............[ Animation | Adventure | Family | Musical | Romance\n    [Runtime ].............[ 1h 16mn\n    [File Size ]...........[ 300 MB\n    [Resolution ]..........[ 624*368\n    [Aspect Ratio ]........[ 4:3\n    [Subtitle ]............[ No\n    [Container]............[ Matroska (.mkv)\n\n\n\nTimon and Pumbaa start to watch the original Lion King movie, but Timon keeps insisting to fast forward to when they come in, because they weren't seen in the beginning of the story or anywhere until halfway through.

Through this, we meet Timon's mother and Uncle Max, discover why he left his meerkat colony, where he learned Hakuna Matata, how he meets Pumbaa, and the perils they encountered while searching for their dream home. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/5255/vlcsnap2010121017h34m15.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/5255/vlcsnap2010121017h34m15.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/9281/vlcsnap2010121017h34m11.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/9281/vlcsnap2010121017h34m11.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/685/vlcsnap2010121017h34m09.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/685/vlcsnap2010121017h34m09.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/img253/2249/vlcsnap2010121017h34m07.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/img253/2249/vlcsnap2010121017h34m07.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c35cb5bb8464797c9ffa696d8242261652af80d0","amp;dn":"The+Lion+King+Trilogy+-+MKV+x264+compression+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c35cb5bb8464797c9ffa696d8242261652af80d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,92,181,187,132,100,121,124,159,250,105,109,130,66,38,22,82,175,128,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
