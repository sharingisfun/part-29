Probably because of the nature of the torrents.   This is what I have to say about that.\n\nI am simply exercising my freedom of speech.  \n\nThis all belongs in the public domain.  I found all these files and learned from these books because of my governments report they did in 1997.  So here is the pdf. \n\n\n1997 REPORT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF BOMBMAKING INFORMATION\n\n    star rule\n\n    PREPARED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n    AS REQUIRED BY SECTION 709(a) IF THE\n    ANTITERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996\n\n    SUBMITTED TO:\n\n    THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n    AND THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n    APRIL 1997\n\n\n\nSo thanks guys for all your help, now get the fuck off my torrents and go eat a dick Jgov and DoD.   The valuable information you have so graciously shared with the world is your own fault.  I will just help to make it easier for people to access because most do not know where to look. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDMCA Notice\n \n\nIf you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and is accessible via the Service, please notify CRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s copyright agent, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (Ã¢â‚¬Å“DMCAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).
