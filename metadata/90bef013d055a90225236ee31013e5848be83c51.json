With its fusion of shimmering electronica and a raw rock vibe, FoW proves to be a very engaging listen. At times quiet and contemplativeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ at other times beat-driven and laced with distorted guitar and melancholic vocals. All the while a bit challenging to put your finger on and yet itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quickly familiar. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that very enigmatic nature thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure to pull you in.\n\nOn a side note, I just wanted to give a shout out to Just Plain Sounds. When I first heard early versions of some of the FoW music, I had not known that it was originally set for a JPS release. After approaching Mark Herbkersman (aka Friends or Whatever) about a blocSonic release, I found out. I have to give props to Anthony Gillison aka Just Plain Ant who was gracious enough to allow us the pleasure. So thank you once again Ant!!!\n\nThank YOU for downloading and listening, I hope youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy it every bit as much as I do. RememberÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ as alwaysÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ share itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ podcast itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ blog it.\n\nPeace\n\nMike Gregoire\n\nFounder/Curator blocSonic.com\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection: Netlabels\n\nArtist/Composer: Mark Herbkersman\nDate: 2010-05-25\nKeywords: blocsonic; indie-pop; pop; electronic; rock; indie-rock\n\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0\n\nIndividual Files\nWhole Item \tFormat\tSize\n00-BSOG0006.pdf.zip \tZIP \t10.2 MB\n00-BSOG0006_192Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t66.1 MB\n00-BSOG0006_320Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t96.7 MB\n00-BSOG0006_Art_EPS_Format.zip \tZIP \t36.8 MB\n00-BSOG0006_Art_PDF_Format.zip \tZIP \t1.6 MB\n00-BSOG0006_Art_TIF_Format.zip \tZIP \t10.1 MB\n00-BSOG0006_FLAC.zip \tZIP \t266.2 MB\n00-BSOG0006_OGG.zip \tZIP \t102.4 MB\nAudio Files \tVBR MP3 \tOgg Vorbis \t192Kbps MP3\n01-TheBurnsWeEarn_192kb.mp3 \t2.7 MB\n\t1.6 MB\n\t3.3 MB\n02-PissTest_192kb.mp3 \t4.9 MB\n\t2.5 MB\n\t5.0 MB\n03-WalkThroughWalls_192kb.mp3 \t2.9 MB\n\t1.7 MB\n\t3.4 MB\n04-NoExcuses_192kb.mp3 \t2.5 MB\n\t1.4 MB\n\t2.7 MB\n05-StuckInMySoul_192kb.mp3 \t2.9 MB\n\t1.8 MB\n\t3.5 MB\n06-BikeRideThroughDesert_192kb.mp3 \t2.4 MB\n\t1.4 MB\n\t2.8 MB\n07-EverybodyStoppedCallingMe_192kb.mp3 \t5.4 MB\n\t3.4 MB\n\t5.4 MB\n08-BeOnSomething_192kb.mp3 \t2.8 MB\n\t1.6 MB\n\t3.0 MB\n09-IfEverybodyHereKnewMe_192kb.mp3 \t2.6 MB\n\t1.7 MB\n\t3.1 MB\n10-SmokeFloats_192kb.mp3 \t1.6 MB\n\t930.9 KB\n\t2.0 MB\n11-TheDeathKnellOfOurAfternoon_192kb.mp3 \t2.1 MB\n\t1.4 MB\n\t2.6 MB\n12-ModernJokes_192kb.mp3 \t3.1 MB\n\t1.9 MB\n\t4.0 MB\n13-TheTerminalReplies_192kb.mp3 \t2.6 MB\n\t1.7 MB\n\t3.0 MB\n14-Shattered_192kb.mp3 \t3.0 MB\n\t1.5 MB\n\t3.0 MB\n15-Maybe_192kb.mp3 \t2.5 MB\n\t1.4 MB\n\t2.5 MB\n16-RecipientNoLongerAtThisAddress_192kb.mp3 \t2.5 MB\n\t1.6 MB\n\t3.1 MB\n17-RichmondIsKillingUsAll_192kb.mp3 \t2.8 MB\n\t1.7 MB\n\t3.6 MB\nImage Files \tJPEG \tJPEG Thumb\nBSOG0006.jpg \t80.3 KB\n\t2.4 KB\nInformation \tFormat\tSize\nBSOG0006_files.xml \tMetadata \t[file]\nBSOG0006_meta.xml \tMetadata \t2.1 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90bef013d055a90225236ee31013e5848be83c51","amp;dn":"%5BBSOG0006%5D+Friends+or+Whatever+-+Friends+or+Whatever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90bef013d055a90225236ee31013e5848be83c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,190,240,19,208,85,169,2,37,35,110,227,16,19,229,132,139,232,60,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
