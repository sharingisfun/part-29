McElroy \n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\n\n\nThe issue of global warming has captured the attention of people worldwide over the past 20 years. Scientists studying the effects of human activities on the global environment today believe we are changing the climate of the planet on a global basis. We are warming the Earth, but are we risking the health of our planet? What are the negative consequences of these actions?\n\nThis course will discuss the complex interdependent systems that regulate the environment of Earth. Also, this course offers listeners a comprehensive overview of the essential environmental issues of our time.\n\nSome of the issues discussed include: air pollution, acid rain, depletion of the stratospheric ozone, destruction of tropical forests, and impending climate changes. We will learn how greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and industrial chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have all played a significant role in what is happening to our world.\n\nAt the end of this course, listeners will better understand the overwhelming impact of industrial pollutants on the planet. \n\nMichael B.
