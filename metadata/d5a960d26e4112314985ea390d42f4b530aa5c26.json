That anticipation has now been well rewarded. Ten brand new rough and ready, in your face metal smashers leaping out of the speakers to savage the listener like a rabid wolf. Since the demo Aldo has joined on guitar, with John still manning the bass and Simon and Emily from The Lamp of Thoth (and all prayers to the gods of metal that the LampÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rumored grave be shallow and premature, the world needs that band) on vocals and drums respectively. Other than that addition to the lineup, not much has changed. The magnificent beast that first roared on the demo is just bigger, stronger and more experienced.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Battering RamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a damn fit title to open this album with. The guitar snaps, snarls and worries the flesh, while the rhythm section swaggers with arrogant authority and SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immediately recognizable vocals lead it all in that inimitable combination of bard, braggart and brigand that has become his signature. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Lord of RÃ¢â‚¬â„¢lyehÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ swings on a vicious hook of riff and melody that so damn perfectly sacrifices the corpse of 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s hard rock on the altar of LovecraftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark god that the retarded herd of occult retro rockers will be gnashing their teeth and shredding their flares in envy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burn the WitchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rides a magnificent riff so head-bangingly perfect it just sears like vintage Judas Priest hopped up on a double shot of NWOBHM spirit. Arkham Witch have an all too rare ability to write songs that are unadulterated metal yet catchy and immediate beyond belief. As you head bang, they burrow into your brain like and aggressive horde of parasites. And there is just no let up at all. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Phantom BowmenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a sterling metal ode to the ghosts of ancient soldiers, who rose to the aid their WWI English brethren. Ã¢â‚¬Å“DagonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ thunders in a gloriously doom laden fashion. This one is wonderfully brutal, a commanding, assaulting and demanding listen.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“March for WarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a loud and proud juggernaut of traditional metal, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Waterfront FistsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is every inch the nasty, violent assault that its title would imply. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The NecromancerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rips, slays and violates the corpse of anything in its path with a wicked arsenal of metal riffs. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Viking Pirates of DoomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ would be a failed attempt at tongue in cheek humor or perilous self parody if done by any band other than Arkham Witch (or TLoT). In the hands of Arkham Witch it is a rousing and infectious metal anthem that will no doubt have crowds going ape shit when played live. The title track closes it all out in grand fashion: guitar wickedly thick and doomy, drums like hammer blows, bellowing bass and the vocals raining buckets of metal attitude all over the epic bed rock of song structure and lyrical content. You gotta love a band that saves the skull crushing best for last!\n\nThere is a wealth of variety and not even close to a single clunker in this over 50 minutes of mayhem. The quality control is iron clad and the spirit is unrelenting. The musicianship is spot on perfect throughout and the songwriting is extraordinarily good. Really there is every reason for you to buy this immediately and not a single not toÃ¢â‚¬Â¦for fucks sake get on with it immediately if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t own this already.\nFile Name Size\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/01- Battering Ram.mp3 9.64 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/02- The Lord Of R'lyeh.mp3 16.33 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/03- Burn The Witch.mp3 10.63 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/04- The Phantom Bowmen.mp3 12.40 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/05- Dagon's Bell.mp3 15.94 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/06- March For War.mp3 10.39 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/07- Waterfront Fists.mp3 7.49 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/08- The Necromancer.mp3 6.58 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/09- Viking Pirates Of Doom.mp3 12.14 MB\n2011 On Crom's Mountain/10- On Crom's Mountain.mp3 20.32 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/01- David Lund.mp3 20.07 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/02- At The Mountains Of Madness.mp3 16.65 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/03- Iron Shadows In The Moon.mp3 9.30 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/04- Infernal Machine.mp3 10.47 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/05- The Cloven Sea.mp3 10.40 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/06- On A Horse Called Vengeance.mp3 14.09 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/07- Gods Of Storm And Thunder.mp3 12.36 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/08- Kult Of Kutulu.mp3 7.81 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/09- Legions Of The Deep.mp3 13.98 MB\n2012 Legions Of The Deep/10- We're From Keighley.mp3 9.59 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a960d26e4112314985ea390d42f4b530aa5c26","amp;dn":"Arkham+Witch+-On+Crom%27s+Mountain+and+Legions+Of+The+Deep+mp3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a960d26e4112314985ea390d42f4b530aa5c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,169,96,210,110,65,18,49,73,133,234,57,13,66,244,181,48,170,92,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
