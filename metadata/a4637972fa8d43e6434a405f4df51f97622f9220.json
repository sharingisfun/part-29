I had a hard time getting &quot;The Complete Recordings&quot; sets.\n\nIn the &quot;Complete&quot; sets I included 2 album arts, 1 is the outer, or bex set cover, the 2nd which I assigned in the ID3 is the inner cd case cover.\n\n\nAgain Seed much, &amp; Enjoy my fellow LOTR fans.\n\nHMD3\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4637972fa8d43e6434a405f4df51f97622f9220","amp;dn":"The+Lord+of+the+Rings+-+Original+%26amp%3B+Complete+Recordings+%5BHMD3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4637972fa8d43e6434a405f4df51f97622f9220","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,99,121,114,250,141,67,230,67,74,64,95,77,245,31,151,98,47,146,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
