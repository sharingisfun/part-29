The film doesn&amp;#039;t skimp on some of the other landmark events of this famous story either. Director Franco Zeffirelli gives more than 12 minutes screen time each to the Last Supper and the Crucifixion. Passages of the Bible are quoted verbatim, the locations have a Palestine-like authenticity, and, aside from some of the principals (Robert Powell as Jesus, Olivia Hussey as Mary, and Stacy Keach as Barabbas), many of the non-Roman characters are actually played by Semitic-looking actors. Zeffirelli diligently provides the sociopolitical background that gave rise to Jesus&amp;#039; following and the crisis in belief it caused for the people of Israel (and one or two Romans). While not graphic by today&amp;#039;s standards, some of the scenes--baby boys being ripped from their mothers&amp;#039; arms and slaughtered, nails being driven into Jesus&amp;#039; hands--may disturb young and/or sensitive children. --Kimberly Heinrichs\n\nCTCA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f997d9cefc7759e62a885b1b69d795eebdd1638d","amp;dn":"Jesus+of+Nazareth+DVD+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f997d9cefc7759e62a885b1b69d795eebdd1638d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,151,217,206,252,119,89,230,42,136,91,27,105,215,149,238,189,209,99,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
