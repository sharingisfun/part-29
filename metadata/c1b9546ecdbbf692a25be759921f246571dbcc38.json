The large tomb-paintings in the British Museum are the most brilliant examples of their artistry but their love of colour shows also in the small vignettes of painted papyri. This book surveys the whole range of Egypian painting, illustrated chiefly by the wealth of material in the British Museum. T.G.H. James examines the material used by the ancient painters and explains the conventions and methods which governed some great artists, whose work should be valued in its own right as well as for its incomparable record record of Egyptian life 3000 years ago","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b9546ecdbbf692a25be759921f246571dbcc38","amp;dn":"Egyptian+Painting+and+Drawing+in+the+British+Museum+%28Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b9546ecdbbf692a25be759921f246571dbcc38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,185,84,110,205,187,246,146,162,91,231,89,146,31,36,101,113,219,204,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
