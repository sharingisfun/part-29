In each episode, host Diego BuÃƒÂ±uel (grandson of legendary surrealist cinema filmmaker, Luis BuÃƒÂ±uel) goes on a behind-the-scenes journey through regions with bad reputations, including: Afghanistan, Colombia, Congo, Gaza, and North Korea.\n\nForced to leave behind his cell phone, GPS and even newspapers before entering the country, Diego BuÃƒÂ±uel must pose as an actor to enter North Korea. Every move he makes is constantly monitored, with two watchers Ã¢â‚¬ËœescortingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ him wherever he goes. Starting in the capital of Pyongyang, Diego is housed in a hotel built on an island to keep visitors from interacting with locals, and where all the rooms are bugged. Attending a Catholic mass in Pyongyang, Diego finds that there are no ordained priests in North Korea; mass is led by party members. Diego also tours a fairground where children have the chance to Ã¢â‚¬ËœKill American ImperialismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in a shooting game. Venturing to the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest stadium, Diego watches 100,000 dancers perform in celebration of 60 years of dictatorship. While this festivity paints an image of happiness and unity, the portrait is not quite as picturesque in the countryside. The effects of poverty, famine and oppression are deeply etched in the faces of its people and the landscape. Even in Pyongyang, the signs of repression are omnipresent Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the number of dances allowed to be performed (only 5-7 according to one party member) to the images of Kim Jung Il found in every corner.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://natgeoadventure.tv/int/show.aspx?id=245&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://natgeoadventure.tv/int/show.aspx?id=245&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:161668bc8d9fac24dc7f378c2b8e3a27dce5f1d0","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Tell+My+Mother...+That+I+Am+in+North+Korea+%28SatRip%2C+Korean","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"161668bc8d9fac24dc7f378c2b8e3a27dce5f1d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,22,104,188,141,159,172,36,220,127,55,140,43,142,58,39,220,229,241,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
