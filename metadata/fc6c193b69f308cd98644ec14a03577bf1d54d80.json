The squadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nickname is because of its penchant for taking on suicide missions that no one else will tackle.\n\nThe PS3 version includes a robust multiplayer mode which includes 11 multiplayer maps, three of which are not included at retail on any other platform.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc6c193b69f308cd98644ec14a03577bf1d54d80","amp;dn":"Section+8+%5BPS3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc6c193b69f308cd98644ec14a03577bf1d54d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,108,25,59,105,243,8,205,152,100,78,193,74,3,87,123,241,213,77,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
