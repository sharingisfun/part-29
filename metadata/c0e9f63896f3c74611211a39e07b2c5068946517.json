But for Elvis, it wasn't. \n\nOf all the live concerts released by RCA during Elvis' lifetime, NONE carried the historical significance of his long-awaited New York City shows at Madison Square Garden in June 1972. Featuring rare photos and memorabilia, this special 2CD Legacy Edition combines the multi-platinum evening show released as Elvis As Recorded At Madison Square Garden in 1972 with the equally compelling afternoon concert issued in 1997 as An Afternoon In The Garden.\n\nOf all the live concert recordings released by RCA during Elvis Presley's lifetime, none carried the historic significance of his long-awaited New York City shows at Madison Square Garden in June 1972. Now, a pair of hour-long performances have finally been coupled in one package for the first time as Prince From Another Planet: 40th Anniversary Edition.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1 - The Evening Show Recorded June 10, 1972\n\n01.
