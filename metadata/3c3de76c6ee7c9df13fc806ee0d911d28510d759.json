And full disclosure, neither of the albums were ripped by me; the debut I got from newalbumreleases.net and the followup from musicbay.co (both are great sites for acquiring newly leaked releases, by the way). I just noticed that 'Sprinter' wasn't available on TPB so I decided to upload it (along with the self-titled debut) in the hopes that others will download it and enjoy it as much as I have","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c3de76c6ee7c9df13fc806ee0d911d28510d759","amp;dn":"Torres+-+Torres+%282013%29+and+Sprinter+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c3de76c6ee7c9df13fc806ee0d911d28510d759","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,61,231,108,110,231,201,223,19,252,128,110,224,217,17,210,133,16,215,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
