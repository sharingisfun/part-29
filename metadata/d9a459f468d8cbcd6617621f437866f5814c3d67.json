But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a459f468d8cbcd6617621f437866f5814c3d67","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+10+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a459f468d8cbcd6617621f437866f5814c3d67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,164,89,244,104,216,203,205,102,23,98,31,67,120,102,245,129,76,61,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
