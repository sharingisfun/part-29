Bassist Melvin Powe and drummer Doug Oscard provide a solid machine in delivering the backbone behind guitarist Richey BÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s excellent slide work. What is particularly exciting about this release is that each song has its own distinctive sound, and the material seems to flow in a natural progression throughout. What appeals is a carefully and quality-crafted debut CD that sounds fresh, new and exciting.\n\n\nThis is the best blues album from a female artist that I have heard in a long time.\n\n\nCheck it out here: http://longtalldeb.com/2011/10/diamonds-on-the-desert-floor/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2bbee2c7d633cdebd619df4d8b09eb0b6362bd","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Long+Tall+Deb+-+Diamonds+On+The+Desert+Floor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2bbee2c7d633cdebd619df4d8b09eb0b6362bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,43,190,226,199,214,51,205,235,214,25,223,77,139,9,235,11,99,98,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
