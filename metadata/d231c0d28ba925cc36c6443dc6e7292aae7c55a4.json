That pixies and trolls and wizards really did roam the Earth in long ago days. You might wonder, &quot;Where did they go?&quot; They didn't go anywhere. In the shadows and hidden places of today's world, goblins sharpen their knives while ogres load their shotguns. Wizards ply their trade from the inner city, replacing lonely tower sanctums with towering skyscrapers. And humanity has no idea. Not until a man who does not come from the world we know stumbles across the unseen presence lurking outside common vision, prompting a pursuit that spans the globe to discover the mystery of the Nocnistu.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d231c0d28ba925cc36c6443dc6e7292aae7c55a4","amp;dn":"Shard+of+the+Ancient+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d231c0d28ba925cc36c6443dc6e7292aae7c55a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,49,192,210,139,169,37,204,54,198,68,61,198,231,41,42,174,124,85,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
