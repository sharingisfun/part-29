The results include ZZ Top-style boogie and blues-rock (&quot;Boogie Queen&quot;), pre-Ted Nugent Gonzo guitar heroisms (&quot;Witness to the Truth&quot;), both of these at once (&quot;Tickelick&quot;), or neither, when it comes to the anthemic Southern rock of &quot;My Last Goodbye,&quot; and semi-hit single &quot;Louisiana Cock Fight.&quot; In addition, several cuts (&quot;No Sun,&quot; &quot;The Nature of Your Taste,&quot; etc.) see the trio augmented by soulful backup singers for a Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen sort of vibe, while others still see the versatile trio flirting with country-rock (&quot;L.A. Texas Boy &quot;) and plaintive balladry (the piano-enhanced &quot;Enigma&quot;). Yet the album's most intriguing/unique quality may be how the deceptively simple, universal, off the cuff material described above features obvious, if nuanced, sophistication, and is offset by lyrically weighty, post-flower power fare as seen in the aforementioned &quot;No Sun&quot; and &quot;Hero of the War.&quot; And the fact that even these would-be progressive tendencies are kept to concise song lengths is what probably spared this album from utterly fatal dating; by extension, further separating Nitzinger's raised-on-the-jukebox-singles wheat, from the era's dominant music-conservatory-on-mushrooms chaff. Originally presented in a deluxe gatefold sleeve, it's not surprising that the Nitzinger LP has long been coveted by '70s rock collectors for the band's one-of-a-kind mixture of earthy grit and fearless (possibly naÃƒÂ¯ve) flights of fancy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b645fd34eac09c9add2b99ee098751f528b32af","amp;dn":"Nitzinger+-+Nitzinger+%281972%3B+2006%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b645fd34eac09c9add2b99ee098751f528b32af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,100,95,211,78,172,9,201,173,210,185,158,224,152,117,31,82,139,50,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
