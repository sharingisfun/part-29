The scene opens with Popeye and Olive Oyl playing checkers on a raft - when they see a big ship and think they are saved. But wait - it seems this is an old haunted ship filled with a bunch of pirate ghosts (no - Johnny Depp is not in this cartoon) who want to scare the spinach eating sailorboy and his girlfriend.\n\n\nPopeye - Patriotic Popeye (1957)\n\nTech Info\nFile Size: 27.1 MB\nVideo size: 320x240\nAudio: 48000hz, 16bps, 2ch\nLength: 0:06:05\nBitrate: 624kbps\nAverage Frame Rate: 29.98\n\nDescription:\nIn this classic, Popeye tries to encourage his troublesome nephews to have some good clean fun for the July 4th holiday. And all they want to do is get to the fireworks shed and blow up stuff. Then - guess what? Why the boys get into trouble and need Popeye to save them, after a healthy dose of spinach of course. Nice animation - a good clean fun American Holiday celebration featuring the pride of the U.S. Navy, Popeye. Also of note - for some reason, the nephews have been reduced to 2 from 4. I have no idea why - and i am not sure which 2 nephews are featured, so i listed all four in the cast.\n\n\nPopeye - Ancient Fistory (1953)\n\nTech Info\nFile Size: 31.1\nVideo size: 320x240\nAudio: 48000hz, 16bps, 2ch\nLength: 0:06:57\nBitrate: 626kbps\nAverage Frame Rate: 29.97\n\nDescription:\nPopeye the sailor man is ?Cinderfella? in this cartoon short and Bluto is the equivalent of the evil stepmother.
