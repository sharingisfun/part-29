The band was on both the 2005 and 2006 Warped Tours.\n\nA Change of Pace formed in 2001 when singer Torry Jasper and drummer Jonathan Kelly began playing together after meeting in a high school Learning Support Class (while attending Centennial High School). In 2003, after a few years of jamming and playing small local shows, bassist Johnny Abdullah and guitarist Adam Rodgers joined the band. From there they were discovered by manager Jorge Hernandez, and within a few months they had a deal with Immortal Records and released their EP Change Is The Only Constant. In 2005 the band released their first full-length, An Offer You Can't Refuse and landed a spot on the Vans Warped Tour. Just a year after their first album, on August 15th A Change of Pace released their second record, Prepare The Masses. The band also added a fifth member to the band, Dan Parker (previously in Don't Let Go). On June 1, 2008 the band announced that they had parted ways with former vocalist Torry Jasper, and announced a new lead singer, Micah Bentley. They also announced the release of their EP, Just No Better Way. With New singer Micah Bentley they have adopted a lighter tone to their music, contrasting drastically with their previous singer Torry Jasper who involved many screaming vocals in the older material.\n\n* Jonathan Kelley: drums\n* Johnny Abdullah: bass, vocals\n* Adam Rodgers: lead guitar\n* Dan Parker: guitar, vocals\n* Micah Bentley: lead vocals\n\n\n\nA Change Of Pace - Change is The Only Constant (EP)(2003)\n\nChange Is the Only Constant is the first EP by pop punk band A Change of Pace, released in 2003.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n2. &quot;Chippie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n3. &quot;Goodbye For Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n4. &quot;Pearl Summer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n5. &quot;Sell Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n6. &quot;A Vague Memory&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n7. &quot;Black Truth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n\n\n\n\nA Change Of Pace - An Offer You Can't Refuse (2006)\n\nAn Offer You Can't Refuse is the debut full-length album released by A Change of Pace on March 22, 2005.
