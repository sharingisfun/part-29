It is based on the reality singing competition The Voice of Holland, which was originally created by Dutch television producer John de Mol as part of The Voice franchise. The show is hosted by Toni Gonzaga, while Robi Domingo, and Alex Gonzaga serve as the show's V-Reporters or the social media correspondents. Sarah Geronimo, Bamboo MaÃƒÂ±alac, Lea Salonga, and Apl.de.Ap serve as the four coaches and the judging panel of the show. The show had a primer called Mic Test: The Voice of the Philippines Primer and was aired on June 9, 2013. The first season premiered on June 15, 2013.\n\nThe Voice is a reality television series that started from a format originating from the Netherlands named &quot;The Voice of Holland&quot;. The whole format features four coaches or judges searching for a batch of talented new artists, who could become the Philippines' new singing superstar. The show's concept is indicated by its title: The 4 coaches don't judge the artists by their characteristics such as looks, personalities, stage presence or even dance moves Ã¢â‚¬â€ only of what they can give with their vocal ability.\nIt's with this concept that diversifies and differentiated The Voice from other known reality talent searches which airs in any known television station such as The X Factor franchise, the Got Talent franchise or even the veteran Idol franchise.[19] The lucky auditionees who have advanced would be split into four teams, which are coached/mentored by the 4 multi-talented coaches who in turn would collaborate with them and choose songs for their artists to perform. There is a minimum of 16 years old of age preference yet beyond that limit there's no specific age range and anyone can audition; The coaches will turn their backs from the stage to facilitate an unbiased perception of the talent. If by any chance one of the coach likes what they hear, they would do a button-press which would allow their chair to turn around and face the performer for the first time, signifying that they would like to mentor them. If it happens that more than one does so, then the artist selects a coach. However, if no coach turns around then the artist is sent home.\nThere are four known different stages: Producers' auditions, Blind auditions, the Battle rounds and the Live shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343d0361069a3e59d1159b994685822657326833","amp;dn":"The+Voice+of+the+Philippines%2C+July+27-28%2C+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343d0361069a3e59d1159b994685822657326833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,61,3,97,6,154,62,89,209,21,155,153,70,133,130,38,87,50,104,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
