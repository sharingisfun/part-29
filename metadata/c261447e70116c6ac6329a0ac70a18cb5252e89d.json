The college-age church group plans to go Manila and help victims of the sex-trafficking industry. Stone's lingering nightmare memories about the sex-trafficking industry has him warning church leaders that the trip is a bad idea. He knows all too well that it could end in violence, and those involved aren't to be trifled with. When beautiful Wren Morgan goes missing, he has a sick feeling that he knows exactly who took her, and for what purpose. The problem is, Wren isn't just any other student. She's someone he was close to, someone he cares about. Now she's in the hands of cruel, evil men, and Stone is the only one who can rescue her before the unthinkable happens.\n\nVisit us at - www.lfrg.co.vu (currently under construction, but feel free to visit, and make sure you leave feedback for us)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c261447e70116c6ac6329a0ac70a18cb5252e89d","amp;dn":"Jack+Wilder-The+Missionary+LittleFairyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c261447e70116c6ac6329a0ac70a18cb5252e89d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,97,68,126,112,17,108,106,198,50,154,10,199,10,24,203,82,82,232,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
