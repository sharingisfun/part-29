Actually djmates' and KSHMR.5's copy of the song are both great; however, for the sake of consistency over having 320kbps constant audio, I tried to find another source.(djmates' copy is VARIABLE 320kbps, while KSHMR.5's copy is a different extended version with an alternate opening) And I found it!\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\nI found a blog (Zippy Releases Brazil) and got their 320kbps copy. At first I had doubts: it could be simply a transcode of djmates' copy, the only one seemingly available. So I checked it on Spek, and did a transcode of djmates' copy in CBR 320kbps. I was surprised when I checked the three mp3 files. The one from Zippy Brazil is better (if I believe that higher colors of green, blue, etc.) indicate better quality. Well I believe it, since my transcode had losses in the spectogram compared to djmates' original copy, but upon comparing djmates' copy in the spectrogram and the spectogram of Zippy Brazil's copy, it seems as if Brazil's copy has more detail! Correct me if I'm wrong at this, but here it goes anyway, the copy. The spectogram screeens are in the torrent too. You can check out for yourself if you want. :)\r\n\r\nSpectogram of Zippy Releases Brazil's copy:\r\nimage\r\n\r\nSpectogram of djmates' copy:\r\nimage\r\n\r\nPM/COMMENT IF THIS TORRENT NEEDS A RESEED!
