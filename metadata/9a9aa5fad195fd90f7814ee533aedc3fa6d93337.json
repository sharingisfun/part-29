A recreation of the biblical story of Cain and Abel, East of Eden follows estranged half-brothers Adam and Charles (Timothy Bottoms and Bruce Boxleitner) as they reunite after the death of their father, Cyrus (Warren Oates). They live together on their fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s land, constantly quarreling, when they meet the manipulative and beautiful Cathy Ames (Jane Seymour), a prostitute with a dark past. The theme of good versus evil runs rampant throughout and entangles itself in the Trask family legacy through each generation. Jane SeymourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brilliant portrayal of Cathy through three decades, from young runaway to aging mother, earned her a Golden Globe. Fans of Steinbeck and Seymour alike will be pleased with this retelling which won an Emmy for best art direction and Golden Globe for best miniseries. This three-disc set features a biography on John Steinbeck, exclusive interview with Jane Seymour, and cast filmographies.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a9aa5fad195fd90f7814ee533aedc3fa6d93337","amp;dn":"East+of+Eden++-++John+Steinbeck+++%281981+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a9aa5fad195fd90f7814ee533aedc3fa6d93337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,154,165,250,209,149,253,144,247,129,78,229,51,174,220,63,166,217,51,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
