It became his second big solo hit (after &quot;Smooth&quot;, on which he was actually a featured artist). The song peaked inside the Top 10 at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at #11 in the UK.\n\nThe music video of &quot;Lonely No More&quot;, directed by Joseph Kahn, does not follow the plot of the song closely and does not have a clear plot in the video. Instead, it focuses on the visual look of the video especially with its special effects which emulate a Rubik&amp;#039;s Cube effect. Thomas can be seen in various scenes as they shift or fold violently into each other (while Thomas remains immobile) from being his bedroom, to a nightclub, and to an office. Although the shifting scenes and objects seem to move by themselves, at one point Thomas can be physically prodding them to move. The video does try to incorporate some elements of the loneliness of &quot;Lonely No More&quot; by showing Thomas looking forlorn in a paparazzi scene and expressing mixed feelings about some girls in the video.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62bbb759bbc887022e8b567d96cb21be50e0cee","amp;dn":"Rob+Thomas+-+Lonely+No+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62bbb759bbc887022e8b567d96cb21be50e0cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,43,187,117,155,188,136,112,34,232,181,103,217,108,178,27,229,14,12,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
