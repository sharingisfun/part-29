Wajda was the son of a Polish Cavalry officer who was murdered by the Soviets during the Katyn massacre.\nThe horse Lotna represents the entire Romantic tradition in culture, a tradition that had a huge influence in the course of Polish history and the formation of Polish literature. Lotna is Wajda's meditation on the historical breaking point that was 1939, as well as a reflection on the ending of an entire era for literature and culture in Poland and in Europe as a whole. Writing of the film, Wajda states that it &quot;held great hopes for him, perhaps more than any other.&quot; Sadly, Wajda came to think of Lotna &quot;a failure as a film.&quot;\nThe film remains highly controversial, as Wajda includes a mythical scene in which Polish horsemen suicidally charge a unit of German tanks.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Lotna.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,305,475,072 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:27:15\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 656x472 (AR: 1.390)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1729 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.223 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 256 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053019/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053019/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Polish\nSubtitles: English, French, Russian, Polish (idx/sub)\n\nMy rip of a Polish DVD posted by furste at KG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:651f3f3368a0edb897f113dabdef4dc0bc356869","amp;dn":"Andrzej+Wajda+-+Lotna+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"651f3f3368a0edb897f113dabdef4dc0bc356869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,31,63,51,104,160,237,184,151,241,19,218,189,239,77,192,188,53,104,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
