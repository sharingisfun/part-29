Alto saxophonist Oliver Lake and bassist William Parker\r\nplay tribute to their fallen comrade with this duet album recorded in 2014 in\r\nBrooklyn. They begin the album with â€œTheme of Marvin Gayeâ€ which has the sparse\r\navant-grade sense of the material, but still flows with Parkerâ€™s sense of\r\nsoulful pulse to gently drive the music forward. They really push the envelope\r\non â€œCheckâ€ with Lake driving relentlessly forward with a torrid wave of notes\r\nand then being able to pirouette on a dime to allow his partner open space. â€œIs\r\nIt Alrightâ€ has the two musicians collectively improvising in an excellent\r\nfashion, Lake with a raw and strident tone juxtaposed very well against\r\nParkerâ€™s deep concrete foundation. On â€œBiscagliaâ€ they both master very quiet\r\nsounds, haunting but respectful, with Lakeâ€™s short bursts of saxophone having a\r\nnear trumpet like tone. Plaintive wails of saxophone and bowed bass on â€œFlight\r\nPlanâ€ make for a freely expressive meeting of the minds. There is a wonderful\r\nduet section on â€œVictor Jaraâ€ where William Parker ups the speed and Oliver\r\nLake dips into his Eric Dlophy bag and gives chase. They reach for the stars on\r\nâ€œBonuâ€ with Lake angling his saxophone for more power and Parker digging deep\r\nin support and conversation.  â€œNet Downâ€ is even more powerful with Parkerâ€™s\r\nsawing bowed bass and Lakeâ€™s high-pitched circular bellows of saxophone, making\r\nfor a very exciting performance. The gospel â€œLight over Still Water Paints a\r\nPortrait of Godâ€ feature Parkerâ€™s expressive bowing bass developing a wonderful\r\narray of sounds to contrast the questing saxophone of Lake who at times\r\napproaches the music of spiritual seekers like Albert Ayler. The raw and\r\ndeclamatory â€œFor Royâ€ ends the album with a proper send off, tough and tender\r\nit sums up the album and what they have learned from Campbell as a\r\nmusician. Both Lake and Parker are in top form, putting their egos aside to\r\nremember their longtime friend and college. The music is at times somber and\r\ndifficult but such was the music of the man they honor, who never shrunk form a\r\nchallenge and left a powerful legacy.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIntakt Records reviews \nhttp://www.intaktrec.ch/rev243-a.htm\r\n\r\nBy Stefan Wood \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/06/oliver-lake-william-parker-to-roy.html\r\n\r\nBy Derek Taylor\r\n\r\nBy Glenn Astarita \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/to-roy-oliver-lake-intakt-records-review-by-glenn-astarita.php\r\n\r\nBy John Sharpe \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/to-roy-oliver-lake-intakt-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php\r\n\r\nDa Aldo Del Noce (it) \nhttp://www.jazzconvention.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2342:oliver-lake-a-william-parker-to-roy&amp;catid=2:recensioni&amp;Itemid=11\r\n\r\nPar Antoine Arlot (fr) \nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Oliver-Lake-William-Parker.html\r\n\r\nPar Luc Bouquet (fr)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:944a7dd82b7a6e1d0140406b64f0ef3e757ff14a","amp;dn":"Oliver+Lake%2C+William+Parker+-+To+Roy+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"944a7dd82b7a6e1d0140406b64f0ef3e757ff14a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,74,125,216,43,122,110,29,1,64,64,107,100,240,239,62,117,127,241,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
