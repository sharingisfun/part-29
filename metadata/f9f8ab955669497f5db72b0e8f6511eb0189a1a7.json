They came to this district to paint from nature in the open air and to make studies for landscape paintings, far from the pressures of city life. Together with Renoir and Sisley, they were following a well-trodden path taken by painters and tourists some thirty years earlier. Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot had been studying the fleeting effects of nature in the forest as early as 1822, and in the 1840s Charles-Emile Jacque, Gustave Courbet, Charles-Francois Daubigny and Jean-Francois Millet made frequent visits to the area, some later taking up permanent residence. Like many innovators, the Barbizon painters have attracted less attention than their followers.\r\n\r\nCh. 1. Landscape painting in Restoration France, 1815-30\t\r\nCh. 2.
