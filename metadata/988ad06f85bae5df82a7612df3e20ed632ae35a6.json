The technicolor is used to best advantage here with some great footage of the Columbia River and surrounding vicinity. And Mann used in support of Stewart, Jay C. Flippen, Harry Morgan, Arthur Kennedy and Rock Hudson all of whom had appeared in Mann films before and/or would again. Anthony Mann is never given credit for the stock company he had. Like John Ford, Mann liked using the same players in his films.\n\nJimmy Stewart is guiding a group of settlers west and along the way saves Arthur Kennedy from a lynching. Turns out they're both former border raiders from the Missouri/Kansas area, but Stewart's decided to go honest. \n\nWhen they arrive in Portland, the settlers are warmly greeted and a deal is made by settler leader Jay C. Flippen for needed supplies for his people during the winter. \n\nWhen Stewart and Flippen return for the supplies, there's been a gold strike and the town is mad with gold fever. They have to take what was due them and then have to fight to get the supplies back to the settlers. Seems some prospectors want them also. \n\nThe point is that there are no options for Stewart and Flippen. These supplies have to get to their colony or they will freeze and starve during the winter. They have to fight prospectors, townspeople and treachery in their own group to get the goods where they are needed.\n\nI don't think Jimmy Stewart has ever been more ruthless on the screen than he is here. His characters in Anthony Mann films are always purpose driven whether it's revenge like in Winchester 73, an outlaw bounty so he can start a new life in The Naked Spur, or even an idea he has like offshore oil drilling in Thunder Bay. \n\n**************************************************************\n\nHello My Dear Brothers and Sisters. This is my first ever torrent upload. It's a small file but full movie. I found it somewhere else. It was not on TPB. For me it's A/V= 10/10. My net is slow, I will be seeding it for at least a week, then I'll upload a few more films of James Stewart and also of Sidney Poitier, which are not available on torrents. I request you to seed it for a long time so that other Stewart lovers can benefit.\n\nYour Comments Are Welcome :-)\n\nThanks - Uj (uj @ yopub.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988ad06f85bae5df82a7612df3e20ed632ae35a6","amp;dn":"Bend+of+the+River-+James+Stewart+1952","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988ad06f85bae5df82a7612df3e20ed632ae35a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,138,208,111,133,186,229,223,130,167,97,45,243,226,14,214,50,174,53,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
