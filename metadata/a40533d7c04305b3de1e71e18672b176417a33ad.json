And even worse, there are hardcoded Hebrew subtitles.  Sorry. Really!  This is all that's available right now.\n\nThis is a 24 part television show where three very successful Israeli chefs select a team which they'll mentor from a huge group of hopefuls.  Background, ethnicity, training and age are not an issue.  Tasting and selections are blind, which I think is brilliant.\n\nThe first seven episodes are the auditions, then to the kitchen battles and then to the finals.\n\nThe chefs are:\nMeir Adoni, executive chef of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCatitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Israel's best restaurant according to the NY Times)\nAssaf Granit, chef and restaurant owner in the shouk in Jerusalem.\nMoshik Rote, executive chef of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamhoud &amp; PlacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in Amsterdam and holds two Michelin stars\n\nFiles type: mp4\nSize: 424  MB\n\nVideo\nLength: 1:13:05\nFrame width: 854\nFrame height:  480\nData rate:  679kbps\nTotal bitrate:  804kbps\nFrame rate:  25 frames/second\n\nAudio\nBit rate:  125 kbps\nChannels: 2 (stereo)\nAudio sample rate:  44kHz\n\nFigured I'd get it out there even without English.  Maybe I'll do the subtitles myself one day although by the time I finish them I'm sure they'll be available. Either way, maybe you'll enjoy it anyway ... I did. And I promise to get the subtitles up here one way or another. If someone knows where to find the raw Hebrew subtitles, I can get them translated so let me know please.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40533d7c04305b3de1e71e18672b176417a33ad","amp;dn":"Chef+Games+S01E01+Pilot+-+Let+the+Auditions+Begin+480p+IggY.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40533d7c04305b3de1e71e18672b176417a33ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,5,51,215,192,67,5,179,222,30,113,225,134,114,177,118,65,122,51,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
