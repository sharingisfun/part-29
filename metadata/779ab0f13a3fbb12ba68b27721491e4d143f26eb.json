Although this album is free, you can help me out so much by buying it from here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://itsdanbull.com/face&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://itsdanbull.com/face&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI want to show that filesharing doesn't stop artists from selling records, it actually helps. I want to show that people who fileshare aren't freeloaders or criminals, but normal people who are happy to support the artists they like. I also want money.\n\nAside from the album, I'm always doing new stuff, and you'll find out straight away if we're connected. You can do that in 4 simple steps:\n\n1. Click &quot;like&quot; here:     \n2. Click &quot;follow&quot; here:   \n3. Click &quot;add&quot; here:      \n4. Click &quot;subscribe&quot; here:\n\nLovely. Anyway, my question is - have you bought the album yet?\n\nLet me know.\nLove, Dan x","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:779ab0f13a3fbb12ba68b27721491e4d143f26eb","amp;dn":"Dan+Bull+-+Bye+Bye+BPI+2012++%5BMP3%40192%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"779ab0f13a3fbb12ba68b27721491e4d143f26eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,154,176,241,58,63,187,18,186,104,178,119,33,73,30,77,20,63,38,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
