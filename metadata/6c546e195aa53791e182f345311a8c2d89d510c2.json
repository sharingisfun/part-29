The Deitels teach Android programming through sixteen complete, working Android Apps. Each chapter presents new concepts through a single App. The authors first discuss what the App does, show screen shots, test drive the App, and present an overview of the technologies and architecture used to build it. Next, the authors walk through building the App, presenting complete code and providing a detailed &quot;Live Code&quot; walkthrough. As part of the code walkthrough, they discuss essential programming concepts, and demonstrate the functionality of relevant Android 2.x APIs. Readers will gain hands-on experience with a wide spectrum of essential Android APIs. The book also has an extensive introduction to programming using the Java language, making this book appropriate for Java courses that want to add an app-programming flavor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c546e195aa53791e182f345311a8c2d89d510c2","amp;dn":"Android+How+to+Program+with+an+Introduction+to+Java+-2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c546e195aa53791e182f345311a8c2d89d510c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,84,110,25,90,165,55,145,225,130,243,69,49,26,140,45,137,213,16,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
