Mozart\ncirca 1776 - 1780\n\nPerformed by the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists\nConducted by John Eliot Gardiner\n\nPerformed on period instruments, in a style replicating that of Mozart's era.\n\nThis is not the complete CD, I arranged the tracks on a CD-R for my own enjoyment and left out alternate (early) versions of the choruses which appear on the official Archiv CD as Tracks 1 and 6. In their place I put the more full-bodied final versions of these choruses.\n\nI've also included a PDF of the vocal score with this torrent, as I no longer have the CD booklet with the text in it.  Even if you don't understand the words, the choruses are very enjoyable.  \n\n&quot;Thamos&quot; was a stage play to which music was added for the hell of it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bc4b7569119236776120d8fdefeb7e44e06d645","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+Thamos+K%26ouml%3Bnig+in+%26Auml%3Bgypten+K.+345+%28Gardiner%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bc4b7569119236776120d8fdefeb7e44e06d645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,196,183,86,145,25,35,103,118,18,13,143,222,254,183,228,78,6,214,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
