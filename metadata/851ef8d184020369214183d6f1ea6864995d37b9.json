Later, after being seen by a record company A&amp;R guy during a residency at the Moonlight Club in West Hampstead, the band were signed to Fiction Records, for which they recorded a single and their first album before moving to Polydor Records. Michael &amp; Miranda was released in 1980.\r\nThis special edition includes the 12 original album titles plus three related bonus tracks and appears on CD for the first time.\r\nThe bonus tracks on this CD include the bandâ€™s only Fiction single â€˜Hunted' and the band's first single 'Needles &amp; Pills' / 'Body &amp; Soul' on Soho Records. The master tapes of this independent single are long since lost, so we have used a vinyl restoration specialist to provide these two tracks.\r\nThe album was produced by label boss Chris Parry, whose credits include The Jam, The Cure and The Associates amongst others.\r\n\r\nAll the tracks have been sourced from the original production master tapes except tracks 14 and 15, as stated above.\r\nThe CD booklet features the original album flip-side front cover (white front or black front cover), lyrics, plus detailed diary entriesâ€”â€˜The Passions' First Album - a diary by Clive Timperleyâ€™â€”from the related period of 1979â€“1980. There is also a UK discography. www.cherryred.co.uk\r\n\r\nTrack Listing:\r\n\r\n1. Pedal Fury\r\n2. Oh No, It;s You\r\n3. Snow\r\n4. Love Song\r\n5. Man On The Tube\r\n6. Miranda\r\n7.
