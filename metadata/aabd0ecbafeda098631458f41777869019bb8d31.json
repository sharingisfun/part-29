Doc Ford, a former black-ops specialist, is a marine biologist on FloridaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sanibel Island. Yet he still seems to always find himself in the middle of a crime scheme. When Doc ends up saving the life of a controversial ex-president, he finds out that the United States is planning a dangerous attack on an oil-rich Central American nation. Doc and the ex-president have only seven days to stop the shady operation from going down.
