Steven is still an over-enthusiastic boy and more often than not, that gets in the way of his progress towards becoming a Gem. However, little by little, episode by episode he learns more about the Crystal Gems, their secrets, their history and the full extent of their powers. (Shape shifting anyone?) But of course, Steven being Steven, sometimes this new information leads to some Steven-y situations that no one, not even the Gems saw coming.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6646cc7120f847a9b996946d8b201329e4b480e8","amp;dn":"Steven.Universe.S01E01.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-ATTVPOT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6646cc7120f847a9b996946d8b201329e4b480e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,70,204,113,32,248,71,169,185,150,148,109,139,32,19,41,228,180,128,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
