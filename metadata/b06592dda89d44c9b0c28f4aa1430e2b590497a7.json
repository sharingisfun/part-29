Her heart is callused, but she still has hope. She may be the last one of her sorority sisters to still be single, but she knows Mr. Right is out there. Reagan is ready to move forward with her life when the time is right, or so she thinks, unfortunately when love is staring her straight in the face she keeps finding ways to hide from it.\nThe last thing Cole Conrad is looking for is commitment. He is set in his bachelor ways and has no intentions of leaving them. Having any woman he desires at his fingertips is how he has always lived. Cole is used to playing by his rules, until he meets Reagan Larson, and for the first time -after what had to have been one of his most fulfilling evenings with a woman- he wakes up feeling alone and used.\n\nGenre: Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06592dda89d44c9b0c28f4aa1430e2b590497a7","amp;dn":"K.S._Smith_-_One_Night_With_Him.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06592dda89d44c9b0c28f4aa1430e2b590497a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,101,146,221,168,157,68,201,176,194,143,74,161,67,14,43,89,4,151,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
