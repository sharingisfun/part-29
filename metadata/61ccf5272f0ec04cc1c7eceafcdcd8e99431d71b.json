Having practiced and prepared to do better, the chefs open up the appetizer basket and fight to stay in it: but one pulpo and fava bean appetizer will not be good enough. Then, in the entree round, the chefs have to stay sharp to cook with cactus and manage their time well. And when the two finalists find a classic cookie and a tangy fruit in the dessert basket, make no mistake both of these former losers really want to win it!\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 17-Feb-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ccf5272f0ec04cc1c7eceafcdcd8e99431d71b","amp;dn":"Chopped.S13E17.Make.No.Mistake.HDTV.XviD-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ccf5272f0ec04cc1c7eceafcdcd8e99431d71b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,204,245,39,47,14,192,76,193,199,236,234,252,220,216,233,148,49,215,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
