Their problems are further compounded when they pick up a ninth passenger - the Nazi captain from the U-boat that torpedoed them. With its powerful interplay of suspense and emotion, this legendary classic is a microcosm of humanity, revealing the subtleties of man's strengths and frailties under extraordinary duress.\n\nIMDb= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037017/\nWikipedia= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat_(film)\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f200cf94e948b48b281fdfc982bea21576865c1f","amp;dn":"Lifeboat+%28Special+Edition%29---+MarkStar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f200cf94e948b48b281fdfc982bea21576865c1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,0,207,148,233,72,180,139,40,31,223,201,130,190,162,21,118,134,92,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
