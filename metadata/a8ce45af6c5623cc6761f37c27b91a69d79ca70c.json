This book presents the status of the field of particle physics at the highest available energies, and presents the recent results and experimental techniques, together with the future of the field. It will be needed and used by researchers from both high energy and astrophysics, since these communities increasingly join to answer key questions of physics.\nFrom the Back Cover\nWritten by authors working at the forefront of research, this accessible treatment presents the current status of the field of collider-based particle physics at the highest energies available, as well as recent results and experimental techniques.\n\nIt is clearly divided into three sections; The first covers the physics -- discussing the various aspects of the Standard Model as well as its extensions, explaining important experimental results and highlighting the expectations from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The second is dedicated to the involved technologies and detector concepts, and the third covers the important - but often neglected - topics of the organisation and financing of high-energy physics research.\n\nA useful resource for students and researchers from high-energy physics.\n\nFrom the Contents:\nPART I The Physics\nSetting the Scene\nThe Standard Model: Our Picture of the Microcosm\nElectroweak and Standard Model Tests: The Quest for Precision\nHard QCD: Still going strong\nMonte Carlo Generators and Fixed-order Calculations: Predicting the (Un)Expected\nThe Higgs Boson: Still Elusive after 40 Years\nSupersymmetry\nQuark Flavour Physics\nTop Quarks: The Peak of the Mass Hierarchy?\nBeyond SUSY and the Standard Model: Exotica\nForward and Diffractive Physics: Bridging the Soft and the Hard\nPART II The Technology\nAccelerators: The Particle Smashers\nDetector Concepts: From Technologies to Physics Results\nTracking Detectors: Following the Charges\nCalorimetry: Precise Energy Measurements\nMuon Detectors: Catching Penetrating Particles\nLuminosity Determination: Normalising the Rates\nTrigger Systems in High-Energy Physics Experiments\nGrid Computing in High-Energy Physics\nPART III The Organisation\nThe Sociology and Management of Terascale Experiments: Organisation and Community\nFunding of High Energy Physics\nThe Role of the Big Labs\nCommunication, Outreach and the Terascale\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 514 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley-VCH; 1 edition (June 21, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3527410015\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3527410019","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8ce45af6c5623cc6761f37c27b91a69d79ca70c","amp;dn":"Physics+at+the+Terascale+%2C1st+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8ce45af6c5623cc6761f37c27b91a69d79ca70c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,206,69,175,108,86,35,204,103,97,243,124,39,185,26,105,215,156,167,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
