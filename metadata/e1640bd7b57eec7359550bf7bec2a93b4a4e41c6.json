Presenting to you, the grand-daddy of all horror games, the original Alone In The Dark Series. \nContents\nAlone In The Dark 1\nJack In The Dark (Teaser mini game before Alone In The Dark 2)\nAlone In The Dark 2\nAlone In The Dark 3\n\nPlease remember: These are NOT GOG version, instead these are the original DOS versions. If you want GOG version, there are other torrents of the same in TPB. Jack In The Dark is missing and size is bloated at least 20 times in the GOG version. \n\nWhy Create This torrent?\nI am fully aware that these games are abandonware but finding them and downloading them took me two hours. Either they ask for payment, like Abandonia, or those scary survey forms must be filled. Attempts to install spyware are there as well. Here you get clean and tested files with no bullshit.\n\nInstallation:\nLike always, Windows users need DOSBOX + DFEND Reloaded\nLinux users need DOSBOX + DBGL \n\nEnjoy and wet your pants mate!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1640bd7b57eec7359550bf7bec2a93b4a4e41c6","amp;dn":"Alone+In+The+Dark+1-2-3%28Original+DOS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1640bd7b57eec7359550bf7bec2a93b4a4e41c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,100,11,215,181,126,236,115,89,85,11,247,190,194,169,59,74,78,65,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
