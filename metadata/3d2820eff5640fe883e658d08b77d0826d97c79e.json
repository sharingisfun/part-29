Their lyrics favour urban and science fiction themes. They are also a noted precursor to punk rock and now are considered a link between the hippie and punk cultures.\n\nFormed in November 1969 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Brock, Hawkwind have gone through many incarnations and styles of music. Critic Jim Green describes their trademark sound as characterised by &quot;that gargantuan and impenetrable pre-metal/hardcore drone, those great riffs, that inexorable drive to destinations unknown&quot;. Dozens of musicians have worked with the group; fantasy and science fiction writer Michael Moorcock was an occasional collaborator.\n\n\nMaterializing in Autumn 2013 &amp; straight from the furthest reaches of space &amp; time comes another dose of the mind-altering substance that is HAWKWIND!\n\n\nBack once more to delight and astound us mere mortals with their timeless blend of Hard-Rock and Psychedelia, blown into orbit on the back of a rocket ship; HAWKWIND once again prove they are the Masters of the Universe!\nWith Exclusive Tracks, ranging from the re-imagining of classic hits like: Ã¢â‚¬ËœSunshipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSeasonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, to BRAND NEW, PREVIOUSLY UNHEARD TRACKS like: Ã¢â‚¬ËœLonely MoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, this is a tour de force of Space-Rock, unlikely to be matched or surpassed by any young pretenders!\nAs if tirelessly producing such an abundant catalogue wasn't enough of a badge of honour, receiving the Lifetime Achievement award for services to Prog Rock has firmly cemented Dave Brock, and HAWKWIND, as two of BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest musical exports.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœSpacehawksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is also available as a Standard CD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stock # 1643925 * Available Soon *\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœSpacehawksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is also available as a Double 180gm Vinyl LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stock # 1643927 * Delayed *\n\n\n\nHAWKWIND: SPACEHAWKS CD Digi-Pak Track List:\n\n01.
