With X-Wing Alliance, Totally Games and LucasArts have at last delivered the game that many players had hoped X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter would be. Superior in most aspects to its predecessors, XWA presents the story of the Azzameen family, a family of space traders. The player assumes the role of Ace Azzameen, the youngest of the Azzameen children.\n\nApart from the usual badges and medals for winning missions - a feature shared by the other games of the X-Wing computer game series - progress is also indicated by the amount of souvenirs collected in Ace&amp;#039;s room. There is also a &quot;mail&quot; delivery between missions that helps to evolve Ace&amp;#039;s background story while also providing a deeper look into his personal relationships and his family&amp;#039;s whereabouts.\n\nXWA is the first game of the series to offer a full voiceover soundtrack and full in-flight dialogue. \n\nGAMESPOT REVIEW: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/starwarsxwingalliance/index.html?tag=result;title;0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/starwarsxwingalliance/index.html?tag=result;title;0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTORRENT CONTAINS:\nRar FIle (Contains 2 CD IMAGES)\nInstall READ ME!\nPatch\nNO CD Fix Files\n\n696MB\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52939db041523471a5ae7b7884026438eb906fc7","amp;dn":"X-Wing+Alliance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52939db041523471a5ae7b7884026438eb906fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,147,157,176,65,82,52,113,165,174,123,120,132,2,100,56,235,144,111,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
