Highlights\ninclude a pair of rare catfight films featuring glamorous women\nwrestling in lingerie; a series of fetish films involving high\nheels, black stockings and black gloves; and a collection of\nprovocative burlesque-style dances.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cultepics.com/erotica.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cultepics.com/erotica.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFour DVDs of untouched video.  A lot of Bettie Page, a little\nLili St. Cyr, and a bunch of other dames.  Bear in mind that\nthese are taken from grainy, skippy, ancient 8mm and 16mm films! \nThey\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re mostly black and white but there is a tiny bit of color.\n\nDisk 1 - The Bettie Page Films\nDisk 2 - The Wrestling Films\nKlaw 3 - The Fetish Films\nDisk 4 - The Dance Films\n\nNo rar bullshit here.  I wish the knuckleheads that rar stuff\nthat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s already max compressed would wake up.  They don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t save\nany space or bandwidth at all, and who wants to download sixteen\ngigs of rar files, then unrar them to watch the movies, but\nstill keep the now useless rars eating up 16 gigs of drive space\nso they can help seed?  Nobody.  That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s why their torrents die.\nNo seeders.  The other day I unrarred one and found an .img\ninside and had to unpack THAT!  FUCK!  (Please don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t tell me\nthat VLC will play .img files... I already know.  I just don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t\nlike it for DVDs.)  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s much better for everyone concerned to\nshare the VIDEO_TS folder and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve done here.\n\nx30001 out.\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb1ecc93f644312c43d08a954d1dfae0a7655912","amp;dn":"The+Irving+Klaw+Classics+-+Bettie+Page+and+More+-+betty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb1ecc93f644312c43d08a954d1dfae0a7655912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,30,204,147,246,68,49,44,67,208,138,149,77,29,250,224,167,101,89,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
