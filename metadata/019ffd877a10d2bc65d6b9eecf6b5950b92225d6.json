Growing up among the hard working and harder playing residents of the Kent Lumber Company, Little Brother quickly acquired the basics of crowd pleasing entertainment, before hitting the road at age 11. From New Orleans to Chicago, he expanded his blues and jazz repertoire during the fertile 1920s, accompanying artists Tommy Johnson, the Chatmon Brothers (Mississippi Sheiks) and numerous Dixieland bands. His recording career, which began in 1930 with Vicksburg Blues and No Special Rider, continued through the plugged-in heyday of Chicago during the 50s and until his death in the mid-1980s. \n\n\nFor the sessions which make up this volume of the Blues Vault Series,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Adelphi Records set up a recording studio in Little BrotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Chicago home on September 1, 1969. Vocalist Jeanne Carroll joined the session, adding her elegant, jazz-tinged tone to BrotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classic New Vicksburg Blues, as well as to songs from the first ladies of the blues--Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey. With modest coaxing from a small, enthusiastic audience, Little Brother Montgomery delivers a virtuoso history of Black American music for the listener. Seldom have we traveled the length of the blues highway with one of its principal pioneers as guide.\n\nTracklist\n1. No Special Rider Blues - 4:14\n2. Prisoner Bound Blues - 4:23\n3.
