THE FIRST HOUR IS MISSING.\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey tells us whatever happened to the band known as The Turtles (&quot;Happy Together&quot;).\n\nThere is a song in the countdown by a man who used to burn money for a living.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Who is the biggest Country cross-over act in the 70's?&quot;\n\nCasey tells how one disco song in the countdown was written by a duo who told People Magazine that they don't like disco.\n\nOne artist in the countdown tried to bar men from attending his concerts, but discrimination laws wouldn't let him. Casey tells the story.\n\n32: Rock And Roll Fantasy - Bad Company\n31: What You Won't Do For Love - Bobby Caldwell\n30: Heaven Knows - Donna Summer\n29: Renegade - Styx\n28: Disco Nights - GQ\n27: Do 'Ya Think I'm Sexy - Rod Stewart\n26: Superman - Herbie Mann\n25: Love Takes Time - Orleans\n24: Shake Your Groove Thing - Peaches And Herb\n23: I Got My Mind Made Up - Instant Funk\n22: Blow Away - George Harrison\nArchive: Half-Breed - Cher\n21: Precious Love - Bob Welch\n20: Love Ballad - George Benson\n19: I Just Fall In Love Again - Ann Murray\n18: Love Is The Answer - England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n17: Lady - Little River Band\n16: Shake Your Body - The Jacksons\n15: Livin' It Up - Bell And James\nLDD: Color My World - Chicago\n14: Take Me Home - Cher\n13: He's The Greatest Dancer - Sister Sledge\n12: In The Navy - Village People\nArchive: Angie - The Rolling Stones\n11: Goodnight Tonight - Paul McCartney &amp; Wings\n10: Sultans Of Swing - Dire Straits\n9: I Want Your Love - Chic\n8: Tragedy - The Bee Gees\n7: Stumblin' In - Suzy Quatro And Chris Norman\n6: Reunited - Peaches And Herb\n5: What A Fool Believes - Doobie Brothers\nExtra:  Close The Door - Teddy Pendergrass\n4: Music Box Dancer - Frank Mills\n3: Heart Of Glass - Blondie\n2: I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor\n1: Knock On Wood - Amie Stewart\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23a98e06fbed5f2f7bd1e5d14b1c6e9090abd007","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1979_April_21st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23a98e06fbed5f2f7bd1e5d14b1c6e9090abd007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,169,142,6,251,237,95,47,123,209,229,209,75,28,110,144,144,171,208,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
