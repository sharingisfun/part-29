The unit includes both men and women, a great deal of the action following the amorous adventures of various members.  The contrast between the surreal combat in Afbaghistan and the comfortable lives of the rear echelon and the people the Guardsmen and - women have left behind is also a recurring theme.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b40a315ed5d91c56df5775655a0447d105a8e823","amp;dn":"Army%40Love+%28DC+Comics+Vertigo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b40a315ed5d91c56df5775655a0447d105a8e823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,10,49,94,213,217,28,86,223,87,117,101,90,4,71,209,5,168,232,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
