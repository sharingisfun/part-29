Its aim is to supply examples and brief discussions of recent work in all aspects of the area in short, sharp chapters. It should serve as a handbook for postgraduates and lecturers new to publishing. The book is written in a readable and lively personal style. The advice given is direct and based on up-to-date research that goes beyond that given in current textbooks. For example, the chapter on titles lists different kinds of titles and their purposes not discussed in other texts. The chapter on abstracts instructs the reader on writing structured abstracts from the start.\n\nAbout the Author\nJames Hartley is Professor at the School of Psychology, The University of Keele, UK.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aab3ccefd106cbde360ae900c43000d7d729c2c","amp;dn":"James+Hartley+-+Academic+Writing+and+Publishing+%5B2008%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aab3ccefd106cbde360ae900c43000d7d729c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,171,60,206,253,16,108,189,227,96,174,144,12,67,0,13,125,114,156,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
