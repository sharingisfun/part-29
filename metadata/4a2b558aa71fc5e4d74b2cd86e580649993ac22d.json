Before it even came out, people were calling it better \nthan Medal of Honor: Allied Assault; MoHAA is widely called the best WWII\ngame ever created.  That would be hard for any game to live up to but in my\nhonest opinion, it lived up to the hype.  Call of Duty features 24 intense\nsingle-player missions and a whole different game mode which allows you to go\nonline via the Internet or LAN to go head-to-head against other players around\nthe world.\n\nCall of Duty is a unique game in that it calls for teamwork, strategy, and \nsquad based combat rather than your typical shooter game in which you just\ncharge ahead and shoot the enemy.  In this game you must cooperate with your\nsquad members. If not you will quickly find yourself looking at a quote from\nWinston Churchill on the game over screen.  The enemies are smart, they will\nuse cover, throw grenades, throw your grenades back at you (I'm not joking),\nand lurk in the shadows or around corners waiting for you to let your guard\ndown.\n\n\nCALL OF DUTYÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 3D Hardware Accelerator Card required - 100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0b compatible 32MB \n  hardware T&amp;L-capable video card and latest drivers*\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® III 600MHz or AthlonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 600MHz processor or higher for systems with \n  WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 98/ME\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® III 700MHz or AthlonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 700MHz processor or higher for systems with\n  WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2000/XP\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ English version of MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 98/ME/2000/XP \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 128MB of RAM \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 8x Speed CD-ROM drive (1200KB/sec sustained transfer rate) and latest \n  drivers \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1.4GB of uncompressed free hard disk space (plus 400MB for WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 98/ME \n  swap file, 600MB for WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2000/XP swap file) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 100% DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0b compatible 16-bit sound card and latest drivers\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 100% WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 98/ME/2000/XP compatible mouse, keyboard and latest drivers \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0b (included)\n\n\nMULTIPLAYER REQUIREMENTS\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Internet (TCP/IP) and LAN (TCP/IP) play supported\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Internet play requires 56 Kbps (or faster) modem and latest drivers\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ LAN play requires network interface card and latest drivers\n\n\n\nProduct keys are located inside the torrent as a &quot;.txt&quot; file.
