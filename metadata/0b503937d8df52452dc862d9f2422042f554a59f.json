It is structured to systemically move from introductory areas through to advanced topics currently being developed from research work. The author concludes with the application of the theory covered to real-world examples, enabling readers to apply their knowledge.\n\nThe author provides background material, covering areas such as wind climate, cable-supported bridges, wind-induced damage, and the history of bridge wind engineering. Wind characteristics in atmospheric boundary layer, mean wind load and aerostatic instability, wind-induced vibration and aerodynamic instability, and wind tunnel testing are then described as the fundamentals of the subject. State-of-the-art contributions include rain-wind-induced cable vibration, wind-vehicle-bridge interaction, wind-induced vibration control, wind and structural health monitoring, fatigue analysis, reliability analysis, typhoon wind simulation, non-stationary and nonlinear buffeting response. Lastly, the theory is applied to the actual long-span cable-supported bridges.\n\n\nÃ‚Â· Structured in an easy-to-follow way, covering the topic from the fundamentals right through to the state-of-the-art\nÃ‚Â· Describes advanced topics such as wind and structural health monitoring and non-stationary and nonlinear buffeting response\nÃ‚Â· Gives a comprehensive description of various methods including CFD simulations of bridge and vehicle loading\nÃ‚Â· Uses two projects with which the author has worked extensively, Stonecutters cable-stayed bridge and Tsing Ma suspension bridge, as worked examples, giving readers a practical understanding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b503937d8df52452dc862d9f2422042f554a59f","amp;dn":"Wind+Effects+on+Cable-Supported+Bridges","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b503937d8df52452dc862d9f2422042f554a59f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,80,57,55,216,223,82,69,45,200,98,217,242,66,32,66,245,84,165,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
