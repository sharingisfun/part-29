I just had mine at Friday 9-23 at The Biscuits and Blues Night Club in San Francisco.\n\nAna Popovic put on the Greatest Live Performance I have ever been too in an intimate setting. Her band is as tight as it gets. All four members of the band are not only Great Musicians but they are Great Performers also. I spent 4 hours just six feet away from a spectacular Blues guitar player. BB, Buddy, Clapton, John Mayer and all you other great guitar pickers, Step aside, Ana Popovic is HERE. She is beautiful also.\n\nThese 2 recordings are great but not half as good as here LIVE PERFORMANCE. If you ever have a chance to see here live, GO.\n\nAna PopoviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡'s father first introduced her to the blues, through an extensive record collection and sessions hosted at the family home. PopoviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ founded her first serious band at age nineteen. Within a year, she was playing outside of Yugoslavia and opening shows for American blues icons like Junior Wells. Her band Hush released their debut album, Hometown in 1998. The next year, PopoviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ relocated to the Netherlands to study jazz guitar. She quickly became a fixture on the Dutch blues scene and soon ventured into neighboring Germany.\nToday Ana and her 4-piece band are booked all over the globe, playing major blues / jazz and rock festivals all over Europe, the US and Canada.\n\n   * 2002 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Three-way nominee for &quot;Best Singer&quot;, &quot;Best Guitarist&quot; and &quot;Best Album&quot; at the French Blues Awards.\n   * 2003 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ First European nominated for &quot;Best New Artist Debut&quot; at the WC Handy Awards in Memphis, USA.\n   * 2003 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nominated for &quot;Best Blues AlbumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ at the Jammie Awards in New York City.\n   * 2004 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Winner of the award Jazz ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Juan Revelation in Juan-les-Pins, France.\n   * 2006 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nominated for 'Best Blues DVD (2005)', 'Best Live Performer', 'Best Female Blues Artist' and 'Most Outstanding Musician (Guitar)' at the 'Living Blues Awards'.\n   * 2007 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nominated for 'Blues Artist of the Year' (BluesWax 2007, USA).\n   * 2010 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nominated as 'Best Overseas Artist' at the British Blues Awards.\n\nAlso known as Ana Popovic\nBorn May 13, 1976 (1976-05-13) (age 35)\nBelgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia\nGenres Blues\nBlues-rock\nOccupations Singer, songwriter\nInstruments vocals, guitar\nYears active 1998ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present\nAssociated acts Hush\nWebsite Official Website anapovic.com\n\n\nIn 2003, she was nominated for a W.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
