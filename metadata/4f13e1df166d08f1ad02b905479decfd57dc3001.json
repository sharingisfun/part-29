They were one of the most popular bands in Yugoslavia right from their arrival on the scene in 1974 until their folding in 1989. At the time Bijelo dugme was falling apart, Goran entered the world of film music. His first project was Emir Kusturica's &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot; (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the music from it). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by Iggy Pop) for Emir's next film &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1993).\n             In 2005, Bijelo Dugme held three concerts sponsored by Coca-Cola: in Sarajevo, Zagreb and Belgrade (at Belgrade Hippodrome, attracting more than 250,000 fans). After the concerts three vocalists continued to perform together outside former Yugoslav republics under the name &quot;Kad Bi Bio Bijelo Dugme&quot;.\n\n\n             Djurdjevdan is a South-Slavic religious holiday, celebrated on April 23 by the Julian calendar, which is the feast of Saint George and a very important Slava. He is one of the most important Christian saints in Orthodox churches. This holiday is attached to the tradition of celebrating the beginning of spring. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f13e1df166d08f1ad02b905479decfd57dc3001","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+303","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f13e1df166d08f1ad02b905479decfd57dc3001","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,19,225,223,22,109,8,241,173,2,185,5,71,157,236,253,87,220,48,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
