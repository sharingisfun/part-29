Through stunning CGI, witness the birth pangs of the solar system, shocked into existence by a nearby supernova, and enduring over 700 million years of brutal bombardment by deadly asteroids; colossal cataclysms that shaped the planets and transformed their climates forever; and startling new scientific discoveries revealing a hellish history of continuous devastation on Earth. And travel to the system's very fringes to explore the possibility that the Sun has an evil twin, a monstrous star known as Nemesis suspected of causing every mass extinction in Earth's history. In signature cutting-edge style, THE UNIVERSE features astounding NASA footage and the opinions of leading astrophysicists to probe even more deeply into the billion-years-old story of the world beyond Earth.\n\n\n\n9)  Our Place in the Milky Way \nAn exploration of Earth's cosmic neighbourhood. Looking beyond the borders of our solar system, what's nearby in our galaxy? How do the other objects in our local area influence life on Earth? And, how did Earth's place in the galaxy make it the perfect place for the development of advanced life?\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8222/theuniverseseason6scree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2170 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 464\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.793 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 23\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 14\n * Part Size: average 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/the-universe/interactives/facts-about-the-universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.history.com/shows/the-universe/interactives/facts-about-the-universe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Universe:_Season_6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Universe:_Season_6&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6d80ac15f1646fd9ac399be0ea45218cd74c901","amp;dn":"History+Ch+The+Universe+Season+6+09of14+Our+Place+in+the+Milky+W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6d80ac15f1646fd9ac399be0ea45218cd74c901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,216,10,193,95,22,70,253,154,195,153,190,14,164,82,24,205,116,201,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
