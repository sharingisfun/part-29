This technology gives you more control over the Visio features you install and updates your computer with only the most recent Microsoft system files that Visio 2000 requires.\n\nThe Visio 2000 Setup program occurs in two major parts:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tA system update, which may require installation of Microsoft system files and, in some cases, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 (see below).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tInstallation of the Visio 2000 program.\n\nThe information in this section describes what happens during each part of the Visio 2000 installation.\n\nNOTE  Installation Path Length Limitation:  To ensure operation of the Visio 2000 solutions, the folder in which you chose to install Visio 2000, Standard Edition must have a path name shorter than 55 characters in length.\n\nUpdating your system\nBefore Setup installs Visio 2000, it runs the system update program &quot;Mssup.exe&quot; to check for up-to-date system files that the Visio program requires and replaces those that are outdated. These files enable Visio 2000 to support Microsoft technologies such as Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), Visual Ba product.\n\nMetafiles, bitmaps, or OLE objects that have been rotated will not be rotated in Visio 5.0.\nGeometry and text blocks that have been added to metafiles, bitmaps, and OLE objects will be removed.\nLine-jump styles will default to the Visio 5.0 arc style.\nCharacter spacing and strikethrough/double-underlined type formatting are removed.\nOutward connection points are converted to inward connection points and connection point angles are removed. \n\nNOTE Visio 2000 products support drawings of far greater complexity than was possible in Visio 5.0 products. Attempting to save Visio 2000 drawings that have a number of objects exceeding the limitations of Visio 5.0 products may not succeed.\n\n\nCAD CONVERSION TECHNOLOGY IN VISIO 2000, STANDARD EDITION\n\nAutodesk AutoCAD drawing (.dwg) and Bentley MicroStation Drawing (.dgn) formats appear as available options when you save a Visio 2000 file. Although these file types are listed, the Visio 2000, Standard Edition, program does not include full CAD-conversion capabilities. For information about CAD-conversion functionality in Visio 2000 products, please see the Visio product comparison Web page (www.visio.com/products).\n\n\nSUPPORT FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE LANGUAGE DICTIONARIES\n\nVisio 2000, Standard Edition, can use language dictionaries provided with Microsoft Word 95, Word 97 and Word 2000. Visio 2000 will use these dictionaries by default if they are installed on the system.\n\nVisio 2000 is not licensed to use all of the language dictionaries provided with Microsoft Word 2000. Currently, the US English release of Visio 2000, Standard Edition, is licensed to use only the English dictionaries. If Visio detects a Word 2000 language dictionary for its default language (e.g., German for German Visio) that it is not licensed to use, it will not use any Word 2000 dictionaries.\n\n\nINSTALLING THE VISIO BUTTON ON THE MICROSOFT WORD, EXCEL, OR POWERPOINT TOOLBAR\n\nYou can install the Visio button on the toolbars of versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint manually by running the Insert Visio Buttons.exe file in the VisioSystemCustom folder. \n\nThe Insert Visio Buttons.exe file will attempt to install the Visio button on the toolbars of the following Microsoft Office applications:\n\nMicrosoft Word 95, Word 97, and Word 2000\nMicrosoft Excel 95, Excel 97, and Excel 2000\nMicrosoft PowerPoint 2000\n\nThe Visio toolbar button provides a one-click method by which to embed a Visio drawing into these applications. The same action can be completed by using an application's Insert &gt; Object command.\n\nNOTE If the VisioSystemCustom folder is not present in your installation of Visio 2000, run the Add/Remove Programs utility in the Windows Control Panel, choose Visio 2000, and click the Add/Remove button. In the Visio Installation Manager, select the Add/Remove option, and then click the Microsoft Office Integration option in the list of features.\n\n\nVISIO DOCUMENTATION IN ACROBAT READER FORMAT\n\nThe Visio 2000, Standard Edition, CD includes online versions of the Visio 2000 printed documentation set. You must have the Adobe Acrobat Reader version 3.0 or later installed on your PC before you can view the online documentation. If you have not already acquired and installed a copy of Acrobat Reader on your PC, you can install version 4.0 from your Visio 2000, Standard Edition, CD. \n\nTo install Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0, double-click the file AR40ENG.EXE in the Acrobat folder of your Visio 2000, Standard Edition, CD and follow the instructions on your screen. For more information on Adobe Acrobat Reader, visit the Adobe Web site (www.adobe.com).\n\n\nSUPPORT FOR THE MICROSOFT INTELLIMOUSE\n\nVisio 2000 provides support for the Microsoft IntelliMouse. The following wheel actions are supported in a Visio drawing window:\n\nRoll = vertical scroll\nShift + roll = horizontal scroll\nCtrl + roll = zoom\nClick + drag = pan\n\nSome of these actions are also supported in other Visio windows (such as Stencil, ShapeSheet, and Print Preview) where appropriate.\n\n\nINSTALLING ON HEBREW AND ARABIC SYSTEMS\n\nThe Visio Installation Manager may fail on Hebrew and Arabic language versions of Microsoft Windows. If you have trouble installing Visio 2000 on a Hebrew or Arabic language version of Windows:\n\n1.\tOn the Visio 2000 CD, find the file Comctl32.exe in the following location:  Installbinwindowssystem32Comctl32.exe.\n2.\tDouble-click Comctl32.exe. Comctl32.exe will update the Comctl32.dll, which is in the WindowsSystem32 folder.\n3.\tRun Setup.exe, located at the root of the Visio 2000 CD.\n\n\nOPEN DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT API (ODMA) SUPPORT\n\nTesting of ODMA support in Visio 2000, Standard Edition, was limited to DOCS Open version 3.7.2 from PC DOCS, Inc. Other ODMA-compliant applications may function as expected with Visio 2000, but certification testing was not performed.\n\n\nCOM ADD-INS SUPPORT NOT IMPLEMENTED\n\nSupport for the loading of COM Add-ins when Visio 2000 is loaded (under Tools &gt; Options, Advanced tab) has not been implemented in this release of Visio 2000, Standard Edition.\n\n\nCRASH OR SYSTEM HANG WHEN WORKING WITH LARGE DRAWINGS ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS 98 USING ADOBE POSTSCRIPT PRINTER DRIVER VERSION 4.1\n\nWhen Visio 2000 is adding a large number of shapes with text to a drawing, a system crash or hang can occur. This will happen only on Windows 98 systems using the original Adobe PostScript printer driver, version 4.1. This problem may appear as a memory leak, which causes all other applications and menus to stop operating. A typical symptom may be an error in GDI.exe.\n\nThe problem can be prevented by installing the newest Adobe PostScript printer driver, version 4.3.1, for Windows 98 available at: http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/pdrvwin.htm.\n\n\nTEXT IS SPACED INCORRECTLY WHEN PRINTED TO LEXMARK OPTRACOLOR PRINTERS\n\nLexmark Optracolor, as well as some other printers that allow substitution of the printer fonts for the TrueType fonts, may print text that is incorrectly spaced. This problem can be fixed by changing the printer driver setting from &quot;Font Substitution&quot; to &quot;Download Soft Fonts.&quot; In some cases, you may need to load an updated printer driver from Lexmark.\n\n\nSYSTEM HANG WITH VISIO 2000 ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT4.0 TERMINAL SERVER\n\nWhen installing Visio 2000 on a Microsoft Windows NT4.0 Terminal Server from a client, the installation process is extremely slow. A typical symptom may be that each component takes minutes to install rather than seconds. Another symptom may be that the installation wizard appears to hang. These delays can be fixed by performing the installation on the server machine.\n\nFollow these steps to install:\n1. Log onto the server as user with Administrator privileges.\n\n\t2. Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel.\n\n\t3. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.\n\n\t4. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Install.\n\n\t5. Browse to the installation source directory for Microsoft Visio 2000.\n\n\t6. Begin the installation process, and follow the instructions on your screen.\n\nAdditionally, there may be an issue running Visio 2000 with Feature Management turned on. A typical symptom may be that the system appears to hang when trying to launch the Visio application. You can fix this problem by opening the registry and running regedit.exe. Then place the following key and value in the registry:\n\n\tKey: HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionTerminal ServerInstallSoftwareVisioVisio 2000ApplicationFeaturemgmt\n\n\tString Value: 0\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Visio 2000, Standard Edition\nEND of Release Notes ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5a4a642bccdd301b05edc6a4c0cfd7d252e942","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Visio+2000+working","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5a4a642bccdd301b05edc6a4c0cfd7d252e942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,90,74,100,43,204,221,48,27,5,237,198,164,192,207,215,210,82,233,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
