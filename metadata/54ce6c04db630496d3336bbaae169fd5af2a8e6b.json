This album includes Mann's &quot;Mushi Mushi&quot; from an earlier date, but it is the lengthy versions of &quot;Patato,&quot; &quot;Stolen Moments,&quot; and particularly the encore &quot;Comin' Home Baby&quot; from Newport that are most memorable.  During this period, the flutist's group included vibraphonist Dave Pike, two trombonists, the young Chick Corea on piano, bassist Earl May, drummer Bruno Carr, and Patato Valdes on conga.  For &quot;Comin' Home Baby,&quot; composer Ben Tucker, who had played earlier in the day as part of Billy Taylor's Trio, sits in on bass. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nHerbie Mann (Flutes) \nChick Corea (Piano) \nDave Pike (Vibes) \nBruno Carr (Drums) \nEarl May (Double Bass) - 1-3 \nCarlos &quot;Patato&quot; Valdes (Congas) \nBen Tucker (Double Bass) - 4 \nJohn Hitchcock (Trombone) \n\nHerbie Mann - Standing Ovation at Newport  Tracks:\n01  Patato (Dave Pike) 8:21 \n02  Stolen Moments (Oliver Nelson) 9:35 \n03  Mushi Mushi (Herbie Mann) 6:02 \n04  Comin' Home Baby (Ben Tucker/Bob Dorough) 10:51 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54ce6c04db630496d3336bbaae169fd5af2a8e6b","amp;dn":"Herbie+Mann+-+Standing+Ovation+at+Newport+%281965%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54ce6c04db630496d3336bbaae169fd5af2a8e6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,206,108,4,219,99,4,150,211,51,107,186,174,22,159,213,175,42,142,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
