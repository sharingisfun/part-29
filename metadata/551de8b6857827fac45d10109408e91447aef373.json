The Girl Can't Help It is more than a good film, more than a funny film, more than an excellent parody; it is a kind of masterpiece of the genre.\n\nWe are dealing with a variation - or, if you will, variations - on the Pygmalion theme. In this case, the sculptor falls in love with a model he refuses to carve. \n\nThe story is put togheter out og 347 gags - Tashlin counted himself - with seven or eight musical numbers that are remarkably well directed and elevate rock and roll even as they satirize it.\n\nTashlin exaggerates Jayne's Mansfield statuesque figure with false breasts and all the rest of it, but instead of ridiculing her, he makes her a likeble and moving personality, like &lt;arylin Monroe in Bus Stop.\n\nThe Girl Can't Help It is funny all the way through, and beautiful all the way trough as well. The picnic on the beach, when Jayne Mansfield sits by the sea in a bathing suit and talks, is a wonderful exemple.\n\nI had a chance to see The Girl Can't Help It three times before I finished these notes. Like all great films, it's more beautiful and more successful each time you see it. You laugh less, but you love it more each time, and you feel increased emotion.  \n-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   FranÃƒÂ§ois Truffaut, in The Films in My Life\n\nÃ‚Â« Tashlin se livre ÃƒÂ  une dÃƒÂ©bauche de trouvailles poÃƒÂ©tiques oÃƒÂ¹ le charme et la cocasserie alternent avec un bonheur d'expression constant... Il n'a pas rÃƒÂ©novÃƒÂ© la comÃƒÂ©die amÃƒÂ©ricaine, il a fait mieux, il a crÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ©. Et dorÃƒÂ©navant, quand vous parlez d'un film comique, ne dites plus : c'est chaplinesque, mais dites trÃƒÂ¨s haut : c'est tashlinesque.
