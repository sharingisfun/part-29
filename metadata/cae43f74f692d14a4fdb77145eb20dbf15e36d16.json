Among the tracks are several longer songs of varying genres: the rock song &quot;Nobody Knows&quot;; jazzy instrumental &quot;Kind of Bird&quot;; and the blues-rocker &quot;Get On with Your Life&quot;. Dickey Betts takes a more prominent role in songwriting here than on most other of the group's albums, writing or cowriting five of the eight songs. Newer member Warren Haynes also has co-writing credits on five songs. There is also a Delta Blues cover of Robert Johnson's &quot;Come On in My Kitchen&quot;.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n   1. &quot;End of the Line&quot; (Allman, Warren Haynes, John Jaworowicz, Allen Woody) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n   2. &quot;Bad Rain&quot; (Dickey Betts, Haynes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n   3. &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; (Betts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:58\n   4. &quot;Desert Blues&quot; (Betts, Haynes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n   5. &quot;Get On with Your Life&quot; (Allman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:58\n   6. &quot;Midnight Man&quot; (Betts, Haynes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n   7. &quot;Kind of Bird&quot; (Betts, Haynes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:26\n   8. &quot;Come On in My Kitchen&quot; (Robert Johnson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:18\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Gregg Allman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, lead vocals\n    * Dickey Betts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar\n    * Warren Haynes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar\n    * Allen Woody ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\n    * Jaimoe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\n    * Butch Trucks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cae43f74f692d14a4fdb77145eb20dbf15e36d16","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+Shades+Of+Two+Worlds+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cae43f74f692d14a4fdb77145eb20dbf15e36d16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,228,63,116,246,146,209,74,79,219,119,20,94,178,13,191,21,227,109,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
