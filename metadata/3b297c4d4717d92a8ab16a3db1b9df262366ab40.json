This outstanding premier package depicts the 'Werewolf' in meticulous detail, both the exterior and interior models display breathtaking realism, the VC in particular is a major tour de force in terms of realism for both FS9 and FSX (note that FSX model is full-spec, not merely a 'port-over') - using AlphaSim's amazing 'RealGauge' tech, in-cockpit framerates and fine gauge detail reach unbelievable levels. All the actual Russian text is there, the Heads-Up display is also fully authentic. The expertly-crafted flight model depicts the physics of the unique Kamov contra-rotating rotor system to the highest level!\n\n   1.
