Arsenal continue their title push with a London derby against Fulham at the Emirates, while there are also home games for fellow high-fliers Liverpool and Manchester City - against Aston Villa and Cardiff City respectively. Other games include Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis welcoming his previous club Stoke City to Selhurst Park, Newcastle United at West Ham United, Norwich City against Hull City and the early kick-off between Sunderland and Southampton.\n\n\nNotes: Done at 50fps to give smoother, more fluid movement. For my fellow football (soccer) devotees.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f87e0acb2665097ad5e0285dab3d4c0455a3119","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2014-01-18+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f87e0acb2665097ad5e0285dab3d4c0455a3119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,135,224,172,178,102,80,151,173,94,2,133,218,179,212,192,69,90,49,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
