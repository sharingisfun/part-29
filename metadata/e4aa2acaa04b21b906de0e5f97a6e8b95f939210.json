I'm going to be uploading my favorite obscure, independent bands to Bittorent for people to download and enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my first, I've uploaded the Second Album by hard rock/electro band The S1nd1cate.\n\n\nIf you enjoy your rock with an electro groove; and if you prefer your industrial goth-free...these guys are definately worth checking out.\n\nAnd because they aren't signed, the album is completely ROYALTY-FREE. So download without the guilt.\n\nIf you do enjoy these guys - check out\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4aa2acaa04b21b906de0e5f97a6e8b95f939210","amp;dn":"ROYALTY-FREE%2C+HARD+ROCK+BAND+-+THE+S1ND1CATE+-+SOUNDS+LIKE+ROB+Z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4aa2acaa04b21b906de0e5f97a6e8b95f939210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,170,42,202,160,75,33,185,6,222,14,95,151,166,232,185,95,147,146,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
