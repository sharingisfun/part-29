You got it in one. However, this is not to say\nthat R Kelly doesn&amp;#039;t have talent - far from it, if it\nwasn&amp;#039;t for the rather more unsavoury aspects of his\ncharacter, he&amp;#039;d probably be doing really quite amazingly\nwell for himself.\n\n&amp;#039;I&amp;#039;m A Flirt&amp;#039; is typical R Kelly, smooth and catchy, with\nKelly never slipping out of his swift, relaxed vocal into\nanything more frantic. Everything is chilled out,\neverything ever so measured. It&amp;#039;s not quite the &amp;#039;Ignition\nRemix&amp;#039; but it&amp;#039;s a funky enough song to catch onto the\nimagination.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae908973d7660f2f10e61506375d628772e87fc","amp;dn":"R._Kelly-Im_A_Flirt_%28Remix_Feat_T.I._And_T-Pain%29-%28CDM%29-2007-SAW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae908973d7660f2f10e61506375d628772e87fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,233,8,151,61,118,96,242,241,14,97,80,99,117,214,40,119,46,135,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
