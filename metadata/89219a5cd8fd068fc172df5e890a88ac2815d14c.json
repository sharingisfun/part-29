The bass players name is listed as John Paul Jones. Not surprisingly dishonest eBay sellers claim it's the Led Zeppelin bassist. I have never seen this album on any JPJ/LZ discography anywhere, so it's highly likely to be another person with the same name.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89219a5cd8fd068fc172df5e890a88ac2815d14c","amp;dn":"London+Rock+Symphony+-+Moses+and+the+Impossible+Ten+%281973+quad+m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89219a5cd8fd068fc172df5e890a88ac2815d14c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,33,154,92,216,253,6,143,193,114,223,94,137,10,136,172,40,21,209,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
