The latest spin-off from the Bronx-born Terror Squad (first introduced by Fat Joe), Pun's quick-tongued delivery and witty lyrics have earned him a highly anticipated debut album, CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. Punisher blew up the spot with the street anthem &quot;I'm Not A Player,&quot; the remix of which featured R&amp;B singer JOE and helped gain commercial success for the Puerto Rican rapper.
