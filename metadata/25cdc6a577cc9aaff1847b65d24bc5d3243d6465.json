Well now you can.  This is Brain Drill, and they are awesome.  They are brutal, Extreme Technical Death Metal.  This is their EP and then the album following it.  They&amp;#039;re the same songs, changed around a little bit.  Who gives a fuck.  If you like the really brutal shit, download them... they are gods... and currently looking for a drummer.\n\n\nBrain Drill\n\nThe Parasites - 2006\n\n1. Consumed by the Dead\n2. The Parasites\n3.
