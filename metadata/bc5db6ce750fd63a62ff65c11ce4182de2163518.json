Michael Caine played Harry Palmer in the films based on three of the first four of the published novels featuring this character, and also later in two original-story films not based on Len Deighton's novels.In the mid-1990s, there appeared two Harry Palmer films with original screenplays and starring Michael Caine. Despite sometimes being titled Len Deighton's Bullet to Beijing and Len Deighton's Midnight in St Petersburg, Len Deighton did not participate in these films.\n\n3 classics and 2 not very popular movies made years later, but if you are like me you want to see them all. Personally I didn't think the two last ones were that bad. I had low expectations after reading other peoples comments though. These two are also in full-frame\n\n\n\nThe Ipcress File (1965)\nCast:Michael Caine, Nigel Green, Guy Doleman, Sue Lloyd, Gordon Jackson, Aubrey Richards, Frank Gatliff\nDirected by:Sidney J. Furie\n\nHarry Palmer is an unconventional counter-intelligence officer. Although a sergeant in the army, he is disrespectful of his superiors but does enjoy the finer things life has to offer. He is assigned to Major Dalby whose unit has been investigating the disappearances of several well-known scientists. Their most recent case involves Dr. Radcliffe and Dalby is prepared to pay a reward to get him back. When they do so, they find that his mind has been wiped clean and the man is unable to function. Palmer also has an unfortunate encounter with a CIA agent whom he kills unintentionally. Now a target of the CIA as well as the kidnappers, Palmer thinks he has solved the mystery of IPCRESS and the identity of the person ultimately responsible for the kidnappings.\n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name............ 1 The Ipcress File.avi\nFile Size............ 851,183,616 bytes\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name.....
