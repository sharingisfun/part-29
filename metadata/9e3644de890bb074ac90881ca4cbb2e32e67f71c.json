Anyone who is questioning the systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narratives relating to history, to current events and to the 'inevitable' future that the system would like to put in place. Anyone on the brink of awakening...&quot; \n\n- Juleigh Howard-Hobson, author of 'Ã¢â‚¬Å“I do not belong to the Baader-Meinhof GroupÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Other Poems' \n\n\n\nThe Baby Boomer generation (known as 68ers in Europe) pulled out all stops when it came to rebelling against their elders, but were treated with kid gloves by the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpig systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ they affected to overthrow. What would happen, though, if a new generation decided to rebel against them? \n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what occurs when a group of young Tasmanians embark on an extended campaign of subversion, exposing the many hypocrisies of the Boomer establishment... \n\nCome and hunt, with the Hungry Wolves of Van Diemen's Land!!!\n\n\n(NB: this is a 'mobi' file - if you want the book free in paperback, just get your local library to order it in!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e3644de890bb074ac90881ca4cbb2e32e67f71c","amp;dn":"Smash+the+Baby+Boomers%21+%28The+Hungry+Wolves+of+Van+Diemen%27s+Land%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e3644de890bb074ac90881ca4cbb2e32e67f71c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,54,68,222,137,11,176,116,172,144,136,28,164,203,178,227,46,103,247,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
