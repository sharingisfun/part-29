Fighting for justice, for freedom of speech, and sometimes even for their own lives, these orators demonstrate the finest resources of language in the service of the most dramatic issues of their day.&quot;\n\nRead by\nNorman Rodway - Samuel West - Elizabeth Bell - Peter Marinker\n\nSpeeches by\nSocrates - Cicero - Martin Luther - Charles I - Elizabeth I - Oliver Cromwell - Abraham Lincoln - Emmeline Pankhurst - and many more\n\nMusic: Beethoven, Haydn, Elgar, Franck, Mahler\nSelected by: Gary Mead and Duncan Sheen\nProduced by: Neville Jason\nCategories : World Social &amp; Economic Biographical\nReleased: 1996 by NAXOS.\n\n\n&quot;In the age of the nine-second sound bite ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reportedly now the average length of time a US Presidential candidate has to present his or her views on a particular issue via a television broadcast ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it may seem indulgent to offer a selection of great speeches, some of which lasted several hours in their original format. Do we still have subjects that stir the emotions as powerfully as those which gave rise to the speeches performed here?\n\nIt might be equally argued, however, that the preservation of some of the finest forms of argument ever made is a moral duty, for without knowing our past we are condemned to repeat its errors. What matter that todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s speeches are, by and large, poor shadows of those of former times? Occasionally we are startled from complacency, and are moved by a politician doing his or her best.\n\nThe speeches selected here are all, in a broad sense, politically motivated, in that they were given in circumstances in which the orator found him or herself pressed to speak in the hope of bringing about change in the public world. This is perhaps as it should be; the speech is by definition a public performance, an attempt to persuade the audience of the oratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s point of view, having gained their attention in the first place.\n\nIf there is a unifying theme to this selection, then it is the suggestion that each of these speeches was given at a crossroads in history. Sir Thomas MoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s speech might be said to have put the final touch to the end of the supremacy of Rome over the Church of England. It is perhaps less evident with some of the other speeches that any turning point was being marked by their particular words on that especial occasion; but turning points of history can be moments when opportunities for change for the better are lost, as well as grasped. Thomas Babington Macaulay, the 19th century writer and politician, and no mean speechmaker himself, said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe object of oratory alone is not truth but persuasion.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It is not for me to judge the truth or otherwise of the speeches here, but each of them, in different ways, demonstrates the truthfulness of MacaulayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assertion. Even Charles I, moments before his execution, is determined to persuade his listeners of the validity of his own position. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLet thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the exhortation in Ecclesiastes. No more then, except to hope that more of our contemporary orators might argue a little more, and assert a little less.\n\nNotes by Gary Mead\nAbout the Readers\n\nNorman Rodway is an Associate Artist of the RSC, where his many roles have included Richard III, Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet and Gloucester in King Lear.
