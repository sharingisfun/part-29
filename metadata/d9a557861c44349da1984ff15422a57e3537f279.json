Filmmaker Semyon Aranovich found the last surviving personal bodyguard of Josef Stalin, who began working for him in the 1930s. This documentary weaves together unprecedented, first-hand testimony with rare footage, including Stalin's home movies. What emerges is a singular portrait of a violent and complex era during which Stalin consolidated his power through brutal repression, yet led the Soviet Union to victory in World War II.\n\nDuration: 01:17:56\n\nI Worked for Stalin\n\nThis is a tale of cunning, betrayal, and fear except it is about real people and real events! Combining the testimony of eyewitnesses with rare archival photos and film footage, this documentary is an insider s look at the tortured history of the U.S.S.R. and Josef Stalin s reign of terror. The film follows Zhdanov, Andreyev, Khrushchev, Malenkov, Suslov, and Molotov, the corrupt thugs of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner circle, as they jockey for power and position. The film charts their diabolical power games, revealing astonishing facts about the individuals who were responsible for the fate of millions.\n\nDuration: 01:07:23\n\nThe Anna Akhmatova File\n\nAnna Akhmatova was a brilliant poet with a dramatic and tragic life story, like most of the people who lived in Russia during the 20th century. We get to see her participate in the Russian Revolution, witness the murder of her son by Stalin's secret police, survive the Siege of Leningrad during WWII, and finally get to leave the country briefly to accept an award in the mid Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s. She chronicles not only pain she has endured personally either in love or in patriotism or in her struggles against Stalin...she also chronicles the struggles of her people.\n\nDuration: 01:06:25\n\nFORMAT: MP4\nCODEC: H.264 (x264)\nAUDIO: AAC\nTOTAL SIZE: 2.92 GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a557861c44349da1984ff15422a57e3537f279","amp;dn":"Stalin%27s_Bodyguard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a557861c44349da1984ff15422a57e3537f279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,165,87,134,28,68,52,157,161,152,79,241,84,34,165,126,53,55,242,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
