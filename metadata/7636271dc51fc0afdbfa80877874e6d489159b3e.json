Erickson explored the far reaches of musical and personal extremes. Young musicians like Jerry Garcia, Grace Slick, and Janis Joplin jammed with the influential group. Following a nightmarish &amp;#039;70s mental-hospital stint that had a devastating long-term effect on his mental health, Erickson&amp;#039;s subsequent solo work with his group The Aliens revealed a singularly brilliant songwriter and performer whose talent was no less impressive for the fact that he was singing about zombies, vampires and aliens. The demons that abound in Roky&amp;#039;s songs are all-too-real reflections of his own troubled psyche, and the combination of the artist&amp;#039;s oddly poetic lyrical constructions and his bracing banshee wail makes it clear, as it wasn&amp;#039;t always, that he&amp;#039;s not kidding! Don?t Slander Me and Gremlins Have Pictures (collection of live and alternative versions), recorded 1975 -1982, document Roky?s genius. Roky Erickson cover versions have been made by R.E.M., ZZ Top, Primal Scream, Butthole Surfers, Julian Cope, The Jesus and Mary Chain and many more.
