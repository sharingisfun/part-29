He was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his writing, which -- in new forms for the novel and drama -- in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation.&quot;\n\nStrongly influenced by fellow Irish writer, James Joyce, Beckett is sometimes considered the last of the Modernists, however, as his body of work influenced many subsequent writers, he is also considered one of the fathers of the Postmodernist movement.  Either way, he is unquestionably among the most influential writers of the 20th century and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;.  His work is characterized by a bleak, tragicomic outlook on human nature, often coupled with black comedy and gallows humour.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB format as indicated:\n\n\n                                   == Plays ==\n\n* BREATH &amp; OTHER SHORTS (Faber &amp; Faber, 1971) -- PDF\n\n* THE COLLECTED SHORTER PLAYS (Grove, 1984) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* THE COMPLETE DRAMATIC WORKS (Faber &amp; Faber, 1986) -- ePUB\n\n* ELEUTHÃƒâ€°RIA: A Play in Three Acts (Foxrock, 1995) -- PDF\n\n* ENDGAME / ACT WITHOUT WORDS I (Grove, 1958) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* ENDS AND ODDS: Nine Dramatic Pieces (Grove, 1981) -- ePUB\n\n* HAPPY DAYS: A Play in Two Acts (Grove, 1961) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* KRAPP'S LAST TAPE &amp; OTHER DRAMATIC PIECES (Grove, 1960) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* ROCKABYE &amp; OTHER SHORT PIECES (Grove, 1981) -- ePUB\n\n* WAITING FOR GODOT (Grove, 1954) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* WORSTWARD HO (Grove, 1983) -- PDF\n\n\n                                   == Novels ==\n\n* DREAM OF FAIR TO MIDDLING WOMEN (Arcade, 1993).
