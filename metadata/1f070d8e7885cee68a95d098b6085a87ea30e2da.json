Of course, they all must cope differently with the budgetary burdens which come their way, and with a front-line service such as the police, the pressure is very much on for them to deliver an effective service regardless of their finances. After all, if they fail, what is left of society? This two-part documentary report examines the state of policing in the UK from the point of view of officers on the ground and the most senior ranks..\n\n\n1)  Uneasy Peace \nThe first programme follows a neighbourhood police team in one of Sheffield's toughest areas to demonstrate how they must work hard to keep the peace, despite the fact that they are facing their biggest budget cuts in modern times. In some parts of Sheffield, tension between the existing white and Asian communities and newly arrived Roma from Eastern Europe is threatening to boil over into violence. In other areas, an epidemic of anti-social behaviour threatens to spiral out of control. With exclusive access to both officers on the ground and the most senior ranks, this follows the neighbourhood police team in Sheffield's toughest patch as they try to maintain order while coping with ever decreasing resources. The film raises fundamental questions about the state of modern policing: with cuts biting ever deeper, is it time to accept there are certain things the police just can't afford to do?\n\n2)  More for Less \nPart two of two. South Yorkshire Police is struggling to rebuild a reputation tainted by the tragedy of Hillsborough and the county has some of the worst crime figures in Britain. The body responsible for inspecting police forces has told the unit to improve those statistics or risk being taken over by government-appointed officials. This film follows officers on the ground and in more senior ranks as they attempt to meet the mandate with drastically reduced resources. However, as the pressure mounts so the cracks begin to appear.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8097/ts96s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8097/ts96s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9721/pdr0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9721/pdr0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/7028/6iul.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/7028/6iul.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/755/te16i.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/755/te16i.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/801/60fs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/801/60fs.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3506/i4grr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3506/i4grr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6353/oo0d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6353/oo0d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8691/xnc9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8691/xnc9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6973/h2p2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6973/h2p2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/7002/yjec.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/7002/yjec.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/1870/y502.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/1870/y502.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6938/yf6t.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6938/yf6t.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6820010f0028245c4659&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2995 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 2\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0486td3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0486td3&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Hillsborough%20-%20How%20They%20Buried%20the%20Truth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Hillsborough%20-%20How%20They%20Buried%20the%20Truth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Can%20We%20Trust%20the%20Police&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Can%20We%20Trust%20the%20Police&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f070d8e7885cee68a95d098b6085a87ea30e2da","amp;dn":"BBC+Police+Under+Pressure+2of2+More+for+Less+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f070d8e7885cee68a95d098b6085a87ea30e2da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,7,13,142,120,133,206,230,138,149,208,152,182,8,90,135,234,48,226,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
