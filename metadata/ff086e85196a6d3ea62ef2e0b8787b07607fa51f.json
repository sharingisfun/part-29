The systems investigated are not restricted to artificial polymer systems, but also cover biologically inspired ensembles, contributing to the broad applicability and interest of the conclusions reached. One of the most remarkable findings is the unambiguous evidence that rings inter-penetrate when in dense solutions; here this behaviour is shown to lead to the emergence of a glassy state solely driven by the topology of the constituents. This novel glassy state is unconventional in its nature and, thanks to its universal properties inherited from polymer physics, will attract the attention of a wide range of physicists in the years to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff086e85196a6d3ea62ef2e0b8787b07607fa51f","amp;dn":"Topological+Interactions+in+Ring+Polymers+-+Davide+Michieletto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff086e85196a6d3ea62ef2e0b8787b07607fa51f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,8,110,133,25,106,109,62,166,46,242,224,184,120,123,7,96,127,165,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
