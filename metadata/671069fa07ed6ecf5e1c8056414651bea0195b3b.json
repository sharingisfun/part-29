It's in glorious, creepy, moody, suspenseful black and white.\n\nThis file was encoded from a DVD rip to mp4 using Nero Recode.  The file is in Nero Digital standard AVC, which is an mp4 file that is made with the H.264 codec.  The audio is 2 channel, high efficiency AAC, and 48 kHz.  The fields have been de-interlaced.  I tested the file, and it will definitely play on Nero Showtime, Quicktime, and Media Player Classic (theoretically, any player that supports .mp4).

It will open up new worlds of video viewing for you. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_lite_codec_pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_lite_codec_pack.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the Avengers episodes from this season, click on the link below, and then click on the title you want more info on. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dissolute.com.au/avweb/emmabw/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dissolute.com.au/avweb/emmabw/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI will be S-L-O-W-L-Y upping all episodes from this season, so check back every once in a while (click on my user name above).
