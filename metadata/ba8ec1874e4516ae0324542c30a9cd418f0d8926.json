The band around Dennis Ostermann again has delivered a album of high quality with Exile Paradise. The preceding EP Where Sun and Moon Unite already showed some of what was to be expected and this is developed further on this album indeed. The single &amp;#039;Promised Land? is a slick single in the well known slightly ethereal electro style. Accessible moreover than ever before, but qualitywise absolutely stunning. On this album the band has paid much attention to musical variation, subtle depth and an excellent production. The recording gets more body due to the use of guitars. Songs like ?Fading Light?, ?Wintermoon?, the very impressive opus ?In Favilla? and Manchmal Redest Du Im Schlaf? are each good electro tracks with a nice build-up and emotional tension. A big part of the success of the danceable songs like ?Promised Land? and ?Fading Light? is on the conto of the female singer Antje Schulz (formerly of Chandeen), as her voice truly sounds angelic when combined with the accessible melodies of In Strict Confidence. This fully developed album is without doubt the best In Strict Confidence have done so far. Exile Paradise is available as one cd, as double cd with bonus tracks and as three double cd in dvd digipack with cd-rom content like a videoclip for &amp;#039;Forbidden Fruit&amp;#039; ( check :). So there is something in it for everyone , depending on your personal wishes. A true gem, this album!\n\n\nEnjoy!
