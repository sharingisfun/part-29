Among them is a beautiful and dangerous spy -- and a treacherous disease which decimates the crew. The ingredients of a wonderfully powerful and dramatic O'Brian novel are heightened by descriptive writing of rare quality. Nowhere in contemporary prose have the majesty and terror of the sea been more effectively rendered than in the thrilling chase through an Antarctic storm in which Jack's ship, under-manned and out-gunned, is the quarry not the hunter.\n\nRead by Patrick Tull\n\n===========================================================\n\nThe Aubrey-Maturin series\n\n 01 Master And Commander (1969)\n 02 Post Captain (1972)\n 03 H.
