No one could tell you what to do. A force to be reckoned\nwith - you were filled with the undeniable feeling that you could\ntake on anything and win.\n\nHaving formed in 1994, Deerhoof is now that fateful age and by rites\nit's the band's turn to go out and challenge the world. The same way a\nrebellious adolescent turns tough and irrational, Greg Saunier, Ed\nRodriguez, John Dieterich, and Satomi Matsuzaki just up and split\nfrom San Francisco, the only home they've ever known as a band, and\nleft behind all notions of what a Deerhoof record sounds like.\n\nThe result is Deerhoof vs. Evil. The musical equivalent of hormones\nraging out of control, it explodes out of the speakers with its gawky\ntriumph and inflamed sentimentality. These are songs that practically\ndemand that you dance and sing along (however elastic the rhythms, or\nabrupt the melodies). Right from Qui Dorm, Nomes Somia (sung in\nCatalan), you know you're hearing a daring band, unafraid of the\nconsequences of failing (critics be damned).\n\nTo document their musical coming-of-age the band members could\nonly trust themselves. Besides their cover of an obscure Greek film\nsoundtrack instrumental (Let's Dance the Jet), and a song done for\nNY artist Adam Pendleton's documentary film installation BAND (I Did\nCrimes for You), these songs were completely self-recorded, mixed\nand mastered in practice spaces and basements with no engineers or\noutside input.\n\nIronically the result is polished, blissfully exuberant, and hugesounding.\nGoing DIY meant freedom to reinvent themselves, playing\neach others' instruments, altering those instruments so drastically as to\nbe unrecognizable, (those aren't Joanna Newsom or Konono No. 1\nsamples, those are John and Ed's guitars), and generally splashing\ntheir sonic colors into the most unexpected combinations.\n\nIt takes only one listen to know itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be a Sweet 16.\n(provided by the artist)\n\n- - -\n\nDeerhoof - Deerhoof vs. Evil 2011\n(Polyvinyl Records)\n\n 1.Qui Dorm, Nomes Somia\n 2.Behold a Marvel in the Darkness\n 3.The Merry Barracks\n 4.No One Asked to Dance\n 5.Let's Dance the Jet\n 6.Super Duper Rescue Heads !\n 7.Must Fight Current\n 8.Secret Mobilization\n 9.Hey I Can\n10.C'Moon\n11.I Did Crimes for You\n12.Almost Everyone, Almost Always\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c968077a1abc175168a67ce9e7f2000438bde27","amp;dn":"Deerhoof+-+Deerhoof+vs.+Evil+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c968077a1abc175168a67ce9e7f2000438bde27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,150,128,119,161,171,193,117,22,138,103,206,158,127,32,0,67,139,222,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
