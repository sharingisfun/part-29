The divorce rate inside the church is the same as outside. Most marriages are just holding on. But what if these Ã¢â‚¬Å“factsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are actually myths?\n\nIn The Good News About Marriage, best-selling author Shaunti Feldhahn presents groundbreaking research that reveals the shocking, incredibly inspiring truth:\n\nÃ‚Â· The actual divorce rate has never gotten close to 50 percent.\n\nÃ‚Â· Those who attend church regularly have a significantly lower divorce rate than those who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\n\nÃ‚Â· Most marriages are happy.\n\nÃ‚Â· Simple changes make a big difference in most marriage problems.\n\nÃ‚Â· Most remarriages succeed.\n\nFor too long, our confidence in marriage has been undermined by persistent misunderstandings and imperfect data. This landmark book will radically change how we think and talk about marriageÃ¢â‚¬â€and what we can dare to hope from it.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Shaunti takes aim at marriage myths that have spread like a cancer through our cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€œmyths that have become self-fulfilling prophecies.
