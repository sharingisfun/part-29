The story focuses mostly on the 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers season and somewhat on the 1946 season with the Montreal Royals. Jackie Robinson and his team stop by a gas station. Robinson is refused entry to the washroom but the team says they'll find another gas station so the attendant allows Robinson to use it. As Robinson comes out, a scout for the Dodgers approaches him and sends him to Brooklyn. He is offered a $600 contract and $3,500 signing bonus which Robinson accepts but he is told to control his temper if he wants to play. Robinson proposes to his girlfriend by phone. She accepts.\n\nDuring Dodgers spring training, Robinson successfully makes it to the franchise farm team in Montreal. After a great season there and spring training in Panama, he advances to the Dodgers. Most of the team soon signs a petition stating they refuse to play with Robinson, but manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) insists the rookie will play for his team. Durocher is then suspended over an affair with a celebrity, leaving the Dodgers without a manager.\n\nIn a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, manager Ben Chapman taunts Robinson, causing him to go back to the dugout and smash his bat. He then returns to the field and hits a single, steals second and third base, and scores the winning run. When Chapman is later asked if he wants to show the world that he has &quot;changed&quot; his attitude towards Jackie, he requests to pose with Robinson for newspapers and magazine photos.\n\nRobinson's home run against a Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher who had earlier hit him in the head helps clinch the National League pennant for the Dodgers, sending them to the World Series, where they would lose in seven games to the New York Yankees.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6383c93812ec8ce1c4e3ae7a3a85e195fb3a4175","amp;dn":"42.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6383c93812ec8ce1c4e3ae7a3a85e195fb3a4175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,131,201,56,18,236,140,225,196,227,174,122,58,133,225,149,251,58,65,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
