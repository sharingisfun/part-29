Microsoft does not consider it a general-purpose OS.[1]\n\nWinFLP is a Windows XP Embedded derivative and as such is optimized for legacy PCs.[2] It supports running applications locally, as well as those hosted on a remote server using Remote Desktop. It can be installed on a local hard drive, or configured to run on a diskless workstation.\n\nWinFLP will not be made available through retail or OEM channels. Microsoft sees WinFLP as an inexpensive upgrade option for corporations that have a number of Windows 9x computers, but lack the hardware necessary to support the latest Windows. It is exclusively available to Software Assurance customers. WinFLP excludes Games, Outlook Express and some System Tools, even with a full install (1.1 GB)[3].\n\nWinFLP was originally announced with codenames &quot;Eiger&quot; and &quot;M\u001cbnch&quot; in mid-2005. Like other Microsoft Windows codenames at the time, these are names of mountains.\n\n[edit]\nMinimum system requirements\nPentium class processor 233 MHz (300 MHz recommended)\n64 MB RAM (128 MB recommended)\n500 MB HDD (1 GB recommended)\n800x600 or higher display resolution\n\nWARNING: don't use the unattended install unless you want to have to crack the admin accounts password with an external program... which is a real pain with VMware. just do the normal entry method and put the cd-key in, it works all fine and you can even do windows update if you want for security patches","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b58ef89cecd0e27876679e1cccb65678113c3c9","amp;dn":"Windows+Fundamentals+for+Legacy+PCs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b58ef89cecd0e27876679e1cccb65678113c3c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,88,239,137,206,205,14,39,135,102,121,225,204,203,101,103,129,19,195,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
