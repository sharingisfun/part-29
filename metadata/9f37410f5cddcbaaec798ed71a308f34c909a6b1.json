This new edition of a bestseller is an invaluable reference for technologists, marketers, suppliers, and academicians who require cutting-edge, commercially valuable data on the most advanced uses for polyurethane, one of the most important and complex specialty polymers.\n\ninternationally recognized expert Dr. Michael Szycher updates his bestselling industry &quot;bible&quot;\n\nWith seven entirely new chapters and five that are revised and updated, this book summarizes vital contents from U.S. patent literatureÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the most comprehensive sources of up-to-date technical information. These patents illustrate the most useful technology discovered by corporations, universities, and independent inventors. Because of the wealth of information they contain, this handbook features many full-text patents, which are carefully selected to best illustrate the complex principles involved in polyurethane chemistry and technology.\n\nFeatures of this landmark reference include:\n\nHundreds of practical formulations \n\nDiscussion of the polyurethane history, key terms, and commercial importance \n\nAn in-depth survey of patent literature \n\nUseful stoichiometric calculations \n\nThe latest &quot;green&quot; chemistry applications \n\nA complete assessment of medical-grade polyurethane technology \n\nNot biased toward any one supplierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expertise, this special reference uses a simplified language and layout and provides extensive study questions after each chapter. It presents rich technical and historical descriptions of all major polyurethanes and updated sections on medical and biological applications. These features help readers better understand developmental, chemical, application, and commercial aspects of the subject","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f37410f5cddcbaaec798ed71a308f34c909a6b1","amp;dn":"Szycher%27s+Handbook+of+Polyurethanes+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f37410f5cddcbaaec798ed71a308f34c909a6b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,55,65,15,92,221,203,170,236,121,142,215,26,48,143,52,201,9,166,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
