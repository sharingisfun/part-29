That means actual commercials, promotional jingles, sound effects, newscast simulations and even record hop announcements in addition to the original records themselves. \n\nIncluded here are:\n 1958 with DJ Jack Carney of WIL Radio in St. Louis, MO\n 1960 with DJ Dick Biondi of WKBW Radio in Buffalo, NY\n 1962 with DJ Russ &quot;Weird Beard&quot; Knight KLIF Radio in Dallas, TX\n 1965 with DJ Robert W. Morgan of KHJ Radio in Los Angeles, CA\n 1966 with DJ Patrick O'Day of DJ KJR in Seattle, WA\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9997995e4243f7e8e32202948b61f1340f645c90","amp;dn":"Cruisin%27+Series+-+A+History+of+Rock+%27n%27+Roll+Radio+-+1958%2C+1960%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9997995e4243f7e8e32202948b61f1340f645c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,151,153,94,66,67,247,232,227,34,2,148,139,97,241,52,15,100,92,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
