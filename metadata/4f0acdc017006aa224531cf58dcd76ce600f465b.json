They wait for dark, trading insults and even finding some common ground; sometimes one has the gun, sometimes the other, sometimes both. Things get complicated when another wounded Bosnian comes to, but can't move because a bouncing mine is beneath him. The two men cooperate to wave white flags, their lines call the UN (whose high command tries not to help), an English reporter shows up, a French sergeant shows courage, and the three men in no man's land may or may not find a way to all get along. \n\n------\n\nOrignal DVD\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f0acdc017006aa224531cf58dcd76ce600f465b","amp;dn":"No+Man%5C%27s+Land+%2F+Nicija+zemlja+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f0acdc017006aa224531cf58dcd76ce600f465b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,10,205,192,23,0,106,162,36,83,28,245,141,205,118,206,96,15,70,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
