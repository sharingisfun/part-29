The idea of the music is to fuse furious hardcore with sludgier, more dark, melodic and resolute post-metal. Second album Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ShameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ came out on Throatruiner Records in Spring 2013 and it sold out in a matter of months. The rest of the year included touring Europe four times, taking on the United States, Mexico, Russia and Ukraine as well as playing their 200th show at Ieper Fest in Belgium in August.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
