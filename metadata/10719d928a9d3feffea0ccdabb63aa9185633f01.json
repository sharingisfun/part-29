Following on from 2013â€™s The Hurting Scene, Pool takes affairs of the heart and malaise of the mind and cuts them wide open with an unflinching and honest approach. Her musical palette has been expanded to take in soulful blues, electronic moods and a greater textural depth compared to her earlier, folkier recordings. Poolâ€™s voice portrays righteous anger, vulnerability and sweet melancholy with a rich and sultry glow that pulls the listener right into the centre of both the pain and victories of her songs. \r\nThe albumâ€™s arrangements, a collaboration with Nashville producer Brad Jones, who also worked on Poolâ€™s debut, are suitably atmospheric, entwining slinking drums and ghostly stabs and swirls of cello and violin with the singerâ€™s own skilful guitar parts. The more buoyant pop tracks employ synth flourishes, always thoughtful and never overblown. \r\n\r\nPoolâ€™s major achievement on her 12-track sophomore album is that each song is individually arresting â€“ itâ€™s something of a masterclass. Poolâ€™s parents could not have bestowed upon their daughter a more accurate first name. The folk artist has a natural gift for melody. Evident, too, is her decade-plus of live experience alongside father and country singer Alby. The prodigal daughter is not a 25-year-old novice who is technically coming of age, still discovering the power and nuances of her voice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Deep Dark Savage Heart.flac \r\n02 - Old Enough.flac \r\n03 - Southern Nightshade.flac \r\n04 - Richard.flac \r\n05 - Black Dog.flac \r\n06 - Romantic Things.flac \r\n07 - How Long.flac \r\n08 - Love, She Loves Me.flac \r\n09 - Mariachi Wind.flac \r\n10 - City Lights.flac \r\n11 - Better Days.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Australia \r\nGenre: Indie-Folk \r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report: \r\nSource : CD \r\nFormat : FLAC \r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM \r\nBit rate mode : Variable \r\nBit rate : ~612-993 Kbps \r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels \r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz \r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10719d928a9d3feffea0ccdabb63aa9185633f01","amp;dn":"%282016%29+Melody+Pool+-+Deep+Dark+Savage+Heart+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10719d928a9d3feffea0ccdabb63aa9185633f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,113,157,146,138,157,63,239,254,160,204,218,187,99,170,145,133,99,63,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
