With this, Kosuke retells the tale of the time their fathers saved him during the Invasion of Konoha with their Formation InoÃ¢â‚¬â€œShikaÃ¢â‚¬â€œChÃ…ï¿½. Somewhat rattled by this story, Kosuke reminds them that great shinobi weren't made in a day. As the team contemplates everything, they decide to perfect their own formation, insisting that they'd be fine because they were not alone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15731a9590ab98c7fc915d524aa516c090b9ac7c","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden%2FShippuuden+239+720p+%28Dual+Audio%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15731a9590ab98c7fc915d524aa516c090b9ac7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,115,26,149,144,171,152,199,252,145,93,82,74,165,22,192,144,185,172,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
