Relational and algebraic methods and software tools turn out to be useful for solving problems in social choice and game theory. For that reason this conference included a special track on Computational Social Choice and Social Software. The 18 papers included were carefully reviewed and selected from 27 submissions. In addition the volume contains 2 invited tutorials and 5 invited talks.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 371 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (July 18, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642210694\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642210693","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a78c9720ee1b95989cb40232985fa15a899d986","amp;dn":"Relational+and+Algebraic+Methods+in+Computer+Science%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a78c9720ee1b95989cb40232985fa15a899d986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,120,201,114,14,225,185,89,137,203,64,35,41,133,250,21,168,153,217,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
