WindowsMobile 6.1 and so on.\nI know that there is alot of coreplayers out there. And i also know that there are alot of the that does&amp;#039;t work. So here it is. The newest version and build. Works like a charm on my Samsung Omnia. I had an older version of Coreplayer and it worked once and then it didn&amp;#039;t start at all. This version works all the time, and better than the &quot;TCPMP&quot; player.\n\nI have also added a small program that you install and then you can install your .cab files from you PC to your WM device in just one click. Very smooth and you don&amp;#039;t have to copy-paste and then find it on your device and the install it.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNo serial or activation required.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65f71ac764512830891e0706197a67c942ec99ec","amp;dn":"CorePlayer.v1.2.5.Build.4506.Pre.Regged.%28Windows.Mobile%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65f71ac764512830891e0706197a67c942ec99ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,247,26,199,100,81,40,48,137,30,7,6,25,122,103,201,66,236,153,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
