Sequels to Bear Family's surprise best-seller, 'Oh So Many Years.' Sibling country harmony at its finest and most haunting! Previously unissued duets with Webb Pierce! Previously unissued King recordings! None of these recordings has been available since the 78 RPM era! Influenced the Everly Brothers and many others! \n\nArriving from West Virginia, the Bailes Brothers were an instant success when they debuted on the Grand Ole Opry in 1944, introducing 'I Want To Be Loved', 'Dust On The Bible', 'Remember Me' and other songs and hymns that have become country and bluegrass standards. \n\nThe Bailes Brothers' story is as compelling as their music. Dick Spottswood's essay sheds light on their career and troubled personal lives, including astonishing details of how they were fired from the Opry at the height of their success, how they alienated Columbia Records in spite of being best-selling artists, and how they wound up in obscurity and poverty after sabotaging a second career as headliners at the fabled Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport. This two-volume collection includes the Bailes Brothers' complete King recordings, created at a legendary marathon session in 1946 and at three more sessions in 1953 when Johnnie and Walter were living in East Texas, and picking themselves up after many reversals of fortune.
