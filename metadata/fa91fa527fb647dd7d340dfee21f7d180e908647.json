Created just fifteen days ago, Frankie Stein is psyched to trade her father's formaldehyde-smelling basement lab for parties and prom.\n\nBut with a student body totally freaked out by rumors of monsters stalking the halls, Frankie learns that high school can be rough for a chic freak like her. She thinks she finds a friend in fellow new student Melody Carver-but can a &quot;normie&quot; be trusted with her big secret?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa91fa527fb647dd7d340dfee21f7d180e908647","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%5D+%5B2010%5D+Monster+High","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa91fa527fb647dd7d340dfee21f7d180e908647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,145,250,82,127,182,71,221,125,52,13,254,226,31,125,24,14,144,134,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
