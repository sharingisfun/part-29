This torrent is for those who have a key, but have lost the discs or have broken discs, or who simply prefer to use the original games over TFD. If you have a serial from TFD, you can use that. \n\n\nYou can burn to CDRs if you want, but I recommend just mounting with Daemon Tools Lite. Everything is much faster that way too. \n \n \n--\n\n \nIF you have problems starting the game, just change the compatibility mode to \nWindows 98 on the following: game.exe, gamemd.exe, Ra2.exe, RA2MD.exe, YURI.exe\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:568e6e4142b87a77a0a29b6bba8818079c531617","amp;dn":"Red+Alert+2+%26+Yuri%5C%27s+Revenge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"568e6e4142b87a77a0a29b6bba8818079c531617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,142,110,65,66,184,122,119,160,162,155,107,186,136,24,7,156,83,22,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
