Koch\nstarring Mamie Van Doren and John (The Lawman) Russell\n\nIMDb:  tt0051139\n\nTitle from container.\nOriginally released as a motion picture in 1957.\nCredits \nMusic, Les Baxter ; \nscreenplay, John C. Higgins ; \nproducer, Aubrey Schenck ; \ndirector, Howard W. Koch.\n\nCast \t\n\nMamie Van Doren, \nLori Nelson, \nJohn Russell, \nDon Burnett, \nEddie Cochran.\n\n\nSummary \n\n\tHitchhiking sisters Penny and Jane land in a Southern labor farm.\n\n(Also can be found in a collection of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.)\n\nMy notes.  \n\nI saw this film listed as a 'you may also like' at IMDb.\nThe film is available in a collection from MST3K.  That, I assumed had the \n'riff trax' sort of voice over first created by Jay Ward, and others including \nMST.\n\n\nFor this reason I am adding the original Untamed Youth to my other torrents.\n\nRock and Roll fans will note Eddie Cochran in a minor role.\n\n\nnotes written  March 25th, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3970fd6e0501a57730f24c580b61181e8fd69ec","amp;dn":"Untamed+Youth++%281957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3970fd6e0501a57730f24c580b61181e8fd69ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,151,15,214,224,80,26,87,115,15,36,197,128,182,17,129,232,253,105,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
