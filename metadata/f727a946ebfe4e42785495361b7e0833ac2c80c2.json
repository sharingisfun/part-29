The band describes the album as &quot;the perfect mix of everything we've done so far, expanded on the Persuader sound while keeping the core that is the band&quot; and &quot;a beast of an album, the true pinnacle of our career so far.&quot; In an interview with Swedish newspaper VÃƒÂ¤sterbottens-Kuriren, Emil noted that the album is &quot;a little more aggressive and a little heavier&quot; than their previous work. The album is Persuader's first release in seven years.\n\nOn September 11, 2013, Persuader announced they had signed with Inner Wound Recordings.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Background\n    2 Recording\n    3 Track listing\n    4 Personnel\n    \n\nBackground\n\nThe album experienced multiple delays in its recording and anticipated release date. The band had been working on the album since at least May 2008, and cites personal lives and work with Savage Circus and other projects, as factors in the repeated delays.\n\nIn an interview with HighWire Daze, Efraim explains the theme behind the album:\n\n    The maze idea can be applied to most of the lyrics, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not necessary a concept album. The idea is that finding the real truth in things, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in religion, the news on TV or your own mindset can be like finding your way through a labyrinth.\n\nRecording\n\nAccording to Persuader's studio blog, the album has been recorded in multiple locations. One of which is described as, &quot;an old haunted house just by the shore of the mighty Kvarken... It's cold, dark and pretty filthy so the ambience for the new album is set.&quot;\n\nOn the band's previous two albums, Piet Sielck of Iron Savior contributed backing vocals. For this album however, the band decided to have Emil and Efraim do the backing vocals. The result, according to the band, is a rawer sound compared to their previous two records. Previews were released on the band's studio diary. &quot;Son of Sodom's&quot; working title was &quot;Behemoth&quot;, and is a heavier track. &quot;Deep In the Dark&quot; shows &quot;a bit softer and atmospheric side of Persuader.&quot;\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;One Lifetime&quot;   \t4:26\n2. \t&quot;War&quot;   \t4:24\n3. \t&quot;The Fiction Maze&quot;   \t5:08\n4. \t&quot;Deep in the Dark&quot;   \t5:31\n5. \t&quot;InSect&quot;   \t4:05\n6. \t&quot;Son of Sodom&quot;   \t5:48\n7. \t&quot;Sent to the Grave&quot;   \t4:58\n8. \t&quot;Heathen&quot;   \t6:15\n9. \t&quot;Dagon Rising&quot;   \t1:27\n10. \t&quot;Worlds Collide&quot;   \t5:30\n11. \t&quot;Falling Faster&quot;   \t5:11\nJapanese bonus track \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n12. \t&quot;Aftermath&quot;   \t4:04\nPersonnel\n\nPersuader\n\n    Jens Carlsson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Emil Norberg Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar\n    Daniel Sundbom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar\n    Fredrik HedstrÃƒÂ¶m Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n    Efraim Juntunen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\n\t\n\nProduction\n\n    Ronnie BjÃƒÂ¶rnstrÃƒÂ¶m Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mixing and mastering\n    Felipe Machado Franco Ã¢â‚¬â€œ artwork\n    analogkid6103      Distribution\n   ..................................................................................................................................................................................Now we shall find some worthy seeders who will keep this alive but can it be done?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f727a946ebfe4e42785495361b7e0833ac2c80c2","amp;dn":"Persuader+-+The+Fiction+Maze%28Japanese+Edition%29+mp3++320k+ak61","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f727a946ebfe4e42785495361b7e0833ac2c80c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,39,169,70,235,254,78,66,120,84,149,54,27,126,8,51,172,44,128,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
