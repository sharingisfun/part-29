Following in the footsteps of Autopsia and Laibach, Julius envisioned a music of symphonic intensity (if not proportion) and Wagnerian drama, propelled by martial rhythms and funereal melodies. It is not a coincidence that in 1998 Julius became a full member of Douglas Pierce&amp;#039;s Death In June. \n\nDer Blutharsch&amp;#039;s first release was an untitled picture LP of december 1996 (reissued in 2001 by Tesco), but the moniker became familiar only with the release of the album Der Sieg des Lichtes Ist des Lebens Heil (Ouroubouros, 1998 - World Serpent, 1998), of the four-song The Moment Of Truth (1998) and of the EP Der Gott (Wnk, 1999). Following the live album Gold Gab Ich Fur Eisen (1999), Julius delivered three gothic milestones: The Pleasures Received In Pain (1999), The Track Of The Hunted (Tesco, 2000), When All Else Fails (Tesco, 2002). \n\nTime Is Thee Enemy (WKN, 2004) is less cohesive, and relies too much on guest musicians. \n\nThe eclectic and elegant When Did Wonderland End? (Tesco, 2006) marked a return to form, with the band capable of grafting all sorts of stylistic detours onto their stately military sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc891e0dee69af7bc098ffff55495046d559b201","amp;dn":"Der+Blutharsch+Full+Discography+160-192+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc891e0dee69af7bc098ffff55495046d559b201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,137,30,13,238,105,175,123,192,152,255,255,85,73,80,70,213,89,178,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
