She's the keeper of three intelligent, talking monkeys, the result of secret experimentation and research conducted by her father. In order to allow the three famous monkeys - the verbose and brilliant Chuck, the sleepy and sloppy Go-Go and the amorous Knobby - to develop socially, Kirby is enrolling them at Forest Edge High School. \nAs the community turns out on a Sunday to greet Kirby and her primate pals, the first person they encounter is Nickels, a reporter for the school paper who becomes a fast friend but is also dedicated to learning the secret origin of the talking monkeys. \n\nWritten by Root Nibot and illustrated by Colleen Coover.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2602ea56034812cb29d0beb5830baa8025c2de72","amp;dn":"Banana+Sunday+%28Oni+Press%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2602ea56034812cb29d0beb5830baa8025c2de72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,2,234,86,3,72,18,203,41,208,190,181,131,11,170,128,37,194,222,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
