But &quot;Arctic Dinosaurs&quot; reveals that many species also thrived in the harsh environments of the north and south polar regions. NOVA follows two high-stakes expeditions and the paleontologists who push the limits of science to unearth 70 million-year-old fossils buried in the vast Alaskan tundra.\n\nThe hardy scientists shadowed in 'Arctic Dinosaurs' persevere because they are driven by a compelling riddle: How did dinosaursÃ¢â‚¬â€long believed to be cold-blooded animalsÃ¢â‚¬â€endure the bleak polar environment and navigate in near-total darkness during the long winter months? Did they migrate over hundreds of miles of rough terrain like modern-day herds of caribou in search of food? Or did they enter a dormant state of hibernation, like bears? Could they have been warm-blooded, like birds and mammals? Top researchers from Texas, Australia, and the United Kingdom converge on the freezing tundra to unearth some startling new answers.&quot;\n\nFile: PBS.Nova.-.S36E01.-.Arctic.Dinosaurs.mp4 (306MB, 53:54)\nResolution: 716x480 (native DVD), 16:9 aspect ratio\nAudio: AAC 48kHz 128kb/s stereo\nVideo: H-264 MPEG-4, 29.97fps\nSubtitles: English CC\nEncoding: Handbrake, RF=25\nOriginally broadcast: 2008-Oct.-07\n\nNote: Wikipedia calls this episode S35E11 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)\n\nPlease seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others.
