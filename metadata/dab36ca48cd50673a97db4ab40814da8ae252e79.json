First, Homer opts into Mr. Burns' 'golden parachute' program and soon finds himself and his family living a life that's less than luxurious on Mr. Burns' tropical island retirement community, which is made entirely of trash. Then, Bart pits himself against Marge in a battle of wills; specifically, will Bart take a bath or not? Finally, Bartman is up to his elbows in ectoplasm when he gets a helping hand from the hapless ghost of good ol' salesman Gil. It's gooey goodness and ghastly gladness that will make you gag galore! \n\nThanks goes to Harkonnen for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dab36ca48cd50673a97db4ab40814da8ae252e79","amp;dn":"Simpsons+Illustrated+03+%28Harkonnen-DCP%29+%5BDCP-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dab36ca48cd50673a97db4ab40814da8ae252e79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,179,108,164,140,213,6,115,169,125,180,171,64,129,77,168,174,37,46,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
