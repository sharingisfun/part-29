We remember the first time we heard about the Magic Numbers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new band have supported Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and being told that they were a 21st-century Mamas &amp; Papas. Frankly, we were excited by the prospect of a young group, two boys and two girls, from the alternative side of the fence, being prepared Ã¢â‚¬â€œ brave enough, even Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to down tools and allow their voices to sing free, minus any instrumental melee. Then we went to see them live, and of course they bottled it, and turned out to be just another indie band, their voices barely audible above the amplified guitar/bass/drums din.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/04/10/marthas-arthurs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/04/10/marthas-arthurs/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:068fe478e1526ae90905ca17617f6c21eef4b650","amp;dn":"Marthas+%26amp%3B+Arthurs...The+Hit+World+Of+Marthas+%26amp%3B+Arthurs%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"068fe478e1526ae90905ca17617f6c21eef4b650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,143,228,120,225,82,106,233,9,5,202,23,97,127,108,33,238,244,182,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
