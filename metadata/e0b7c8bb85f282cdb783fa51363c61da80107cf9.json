It was recently noted that my share of Glenn Packiam's &quot;Mystery Of Faith&quot; was suspiciously missing tracks #3 and #5.  The way I understand it is they weren't tracks at all.  They were spoken word.  As a matter of fact, track #3 was called &quot;The Nicene Creed&quot; and can be found on youtube, and track #5 was called &quot;Prayer Of Confession.&quot;\n\nIt was also noted that The After's &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; album I shared in my last 2013 bundle had some encoding/cracking noises.  I have since acquired a fixed copy of that album which I am including in this 14th bundle today, for those interested in replacing their faulty copy.\n\nAnd, speaking of this 14th bundle, there are some really good ones in here today including Fred Hammond's long awaited &quot;United Tenors&quot;, Kurt Carr's two disc &quot;Bless This House&quot; which I have been unsuccessful in finding until just recently, Martin Smith's full length &quot;God's Great Dance Floor - Step 1&quot;, and many others.\n\nOur year-to-date total for 2013 up to 398 releases.\n\nThis 14th bundle includes the following 26 titles...\n\n * Ace Augustine - 2013 - The Sick And Suffering\n * Afters, The - 2013 - Life Is Beautiful (FIXED)\n * Alena - 2013 - Daybreak - Single\n * Andrew Ripp - 2013 - Won't Let Go\n * Citizen Way - 2013 - Love Is The Evidence\n * David Thulin - 2013 - Reconstruction\n * DJ Cmd - 2013 - Dance 66 - Dance With Me\n * Fred Hammond - 2013 - United Tenors Hammond Hollister Roberson Wilson\n * Jonathan Nelson - 2013 - Finish Strong\n * Judah And The Lion - 2013 - Sweet Tennessee\n * Kurt Carr - 2013 - Bless This House\n * Life On Repeat - 2013 - Forgotten - Single\n * Martin Smith - 2013 - God's Great Dance Floor - Step 1\n * Mumford And Sons - 2013 - Live From Bull Moose\n * My Epic - 2013 - Hail - Single\n * Nicole T - 2013 - Ready To Surrender - Single\n * Paper Kites, The - 2013 - Youth North EP\n * Parabelle - 2013 - Air\n * Patrick Ryan Clark - 2013 - Lifted Up\n * Philip Reeves - 2013 - Banjo Space Warrior\n * Resonate Church - 2013 - Be Thou My Vision - Single\n * Skillet - 2013 - American Noise - Single\n * Steven Malcolm - 2013 - Real Hip Hop\n * Sy-1 - 2013 - Whispers Of Love\n * Todd Dulaney - 2013 - Pulling Me Through\n * Yunng Royalty - 2013 - Pen And Pad, Vol 1\n\nIn Praise,\nTorrentTracts - April 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0b7c8bb85f282cdb783fa51363c61da80107cf9","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+14%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0b7c8bb85f282cdb783fa51363c61da80107cf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,183,200,187,133,242,130,205,183,131,250,81,54,60,97,218,128,16,124,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
