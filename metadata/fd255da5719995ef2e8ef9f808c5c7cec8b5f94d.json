An alien gives each a container holding capsules. No power on earth can open a given container except a mental command from the person to whom it is given. Each person has been provided with the power of life and death. Any of these individuals has the capability to instantaneously launch the capsules to whatever coordinates he/she chooses, and each capsule will then eradicate all human life within a 3,000-mile radius of its designated location.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome Reviews (taken from IMDB)\n\nfrom Noel Bailey:\n\nGrossly undervalued, under-marketed and overlooked piece of Scifi. Intellectually right up there with THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and presenting in some ways many of the inter-racial and socially irresponsible foibles that human-kind finds so entrenched. Made at a time of the escalating Cold War, the film unashamedly picks its sides but hey, its an American production!\n\nI saw the film on its initial release when I was just 12, I could hardly then lay claim to knowledge of all things political, but I KNEW a good film when I saw one. In the viewings since (and it is shown way too infrequently on cable) I have come to admire its message and inherent brilliance.\n\nAn alien civilisation whose planet is pretty much the next dead thing (WAR OF THE WORLDS, THIS ISLAND EARTH, etc) looks to speed up destruction of the human condition by giving a representative of each of the five super-powers the ability to eradicate life in totality. For the purpose, an alien drops in with a few vials of 'wipe-out' and hands them out to the chosen five before retiring to the referee's corner to watch the game.\n\nGene Barry, who played it so cool in WAR OF THE WORLDS is the US agent with the chiselled chin and all the right accreditation. The supporting cast are all good and with hands-on direction, about the only thing to let it down are the micro-cosmic budget-restrictions. It remains though a classic film of the genre and is deserving of a much higher profile than that it currently enjoys. Probably due for a remake about this time. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom scotmachigh\n\nThis a very thoughtful film. Even though the film takes place in 1957 the subject matter is current into todays world. The film makes you think of society as a whole. Not of just one nation. The ills and the good of human relations with each other and our surroundings. How far we would go to make this world a far better place or a Hell of earth. It makes you stop and think, what would you do with the power the people were given in the film. The effects were average for a film of the time period. Great effects were not needed though. Watch, listen and think. The film gets better each time you watch it.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom BaronBl00d\n\nAn alien ship picks up five different people from the five super powers of the world. There he gives each a device that only they can open. Each device contains three vials that have the power to annihilate every human being on Earth. The aliens are a dying race from a dying planet, and even though they can and will not destroy mankind on earth, they will speed up the process of seeing whether mankind will destroy itself. How long is the experiment of seeing whether these five will survive and live without opening the vials? 27 days. This is a thought-provoking film about the nature of man more than anything. The underlying point behind the film is that mankind needs to rise from its child-like state of fighting and killing itself over seemingly petty issues. The aliens act merely as referees watching and waiting to see if the Soviet Union will destroy North America or vice versa. Now, the film definitely has an anti-communist slant(not that there is anything wrong with that)but admonishes all negativity, power hunger, and perniciousness in humankind worldwide. Director Will Asher does a fine job setting up the pace of the story and creating tension. The script, even though very weak in some areas, is quite interesting and full of thoughtful insights. Gene Barry plays the American representative and is good as a cynic. The rest of the cast is also very good with George Voskovec as a German scientist and Stephan Schnabel as a Soviet general standing out. Arnold Moss is the alien and he certainly makes his screen presence memorable. A good film. After watching I kept wondering what I would do if given the same circumstances, and I must confess I am so very happy that that burden lies not on my shoulders! Take some time to see The 27th Day and enjoy! \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.27 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 15mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 405 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2008-12-31 10:18:20\nWriting application              : mkvmerge v2.2.0 ('Turn It On Again')\nWriting library                  : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f1b9989699b1bdc4dfc0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nMuxing mode                      : Container profile=&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6b3e050005041c052b5e455a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 15mn\nBit rate                         : 2 108 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 2 210 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.300\nTitle                            : The 27th Day\nWriting library                  : x264 core 58 svn-736bm\nLanguage                         : English\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nDuration                         : 1h 15mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nTitle                            : English 1.0\nLanguage                         : English\n\nText\nFormat                           : UTF-8\nCodec ID                         : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info                    : UTF-8 Plain Text\nTitle                            : EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol\nLanguage                         : Spanish\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is intended to be played on a PC or a HTPC.
