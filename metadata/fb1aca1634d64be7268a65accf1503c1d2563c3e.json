John Hawkes, in his search for a means to transcend outworn modes of fictional realism, has discovered a highly original technique for objectifying the perennial degradation of mankind within a context of fantasyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Nowhere has the nightmare of human terror and the deracinated sensibility been more concisely analyzed than in The Cannibal. Yet one is aware throughout that such analysis proceeds only in terms of a resolutely committed humanism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Hayden Carruth on John Hawkes's The Cannibal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1aca1634d64be7268a65accf1503c1d2563c3e","amp;dn":"Hawkes%2C+John+-+The+Cannibal.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1aca1634d64be7268a65accf1503c1d2563c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,26,202,22,52,214,75,231,38,138,101,172,207,21,3,193,210,86,60,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
