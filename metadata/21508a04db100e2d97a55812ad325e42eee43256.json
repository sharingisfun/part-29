I (Glenn Scott) started ENDOR with Bart van Wallenberg (SINISTER HOL) back in '88/'89. We did one gig then other members joined the band on bass came Ed Heijnsdijk and on drums Danny Gans. For a couple of years we hit the streets with this formation. We have supported ACID REIGN from England THERIAC from Holland this was very nice after this Endor went through some changes. We got an other drummer Peter, he was from another band called.......After a couple of shows the band split up, Bart went to join Sinister and the rest I forgot. But then my brother James came to join me as well as my nephew Erwin. With this formation Endor really came loose: all the demotapes I made except for BORN OF DEMONSEED was with these 2 members. My nephew went away and than Fred Nobel came on bass, then the rest of the music came. Allthough I wrote everything for ENDOR all my bandmembers were a source of inspiration. Now in 2005 the band split up to be reborn again in 2008, I'm still selecting new members so I can not tell you much about it. The one thing I can tell you is that I found an old school Trash metal guitarist, he will join Endor as soon as we have a qualified drummer. This story will continue...\n\nmore info's: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Endor/39153&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Endor/39153&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21508a04db100e2d97a55812ad325e42eee43256","amp;dn":"ENDOR+-+Hell+Is+Back+%2A2001%2A+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21508a04db100e2d97a55812ad325e42eee43256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,80,138,4,219,16,14,45,151,165,88,18,173,50,94,66,238,228,50,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
