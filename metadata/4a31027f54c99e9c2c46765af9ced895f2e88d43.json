Video &amp; Audio came out nicely. A couple duck and covers as to be\nexpected, shot stage right. Was shot 2nd row from elevated seats over the floor, only\ndownside is the people in the first row would occasionally stand up and block all but a\nview of Ler. The 1st 10 minutes of the show I am tweaking audio levels and video settings as\nmy hold button kept coming unlocked, and once in the middle of the show the\nvideo goes into a long exposure mode. Aside from that should be very enjoyable.\nThe angle wasn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t optimal but suffices well. Can\\\\\\&amp;#039;t see much of Herb at all due to it.\nDuring the encore had to stand up and aim due to the people standing up and I wasn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t\ngoing to miss pudding time / tommy the cat.\n\nAlso, there are audible blips in the audio, these are just part of transfer and are not on the\nactual tape. I\\\\\\&amp;#039;m not going to retransfer the show to save wear and tear on the\nhardware, so you\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll just have to deal with it.\n\nWhile you\\\\\\&amp;#039;re here head to this link to download their last show in the San Diego area back on February 5th, 2000 (audio only).\nBe repsonsible with this and all other recordings you find on torrent sites. Abuse of them will\nmake future recordings unavailable. Go out of your way to head to ebay and report\npeople who sell bootleg CD\\\\\\&amp;#039;s &amp; DVD\\\\\\&amp;#039;s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a31027f54c99e9c2c46765af9ced895f2e88d43","amp;dn":"Primus+-+2006-12-08+-+DVD+%28reseed+from+bt.etree.org%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a31027f54c99e9c2c46765af9ced895f2e88d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,49,2,127,84,201,158,156,44,70,118,90,249,206,216,149,242,232,141,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
