Some other information, such as Year, Genre, and Publisher may have been added if the information was available to me.\n\nFLAC cannot be encoded in a usable fashion with tags, so you must add them yourself. \n\nAll albums will have album art included if it was available to me.\n\nAll MP3 files that I upload are encoded at TRUE 320 kbps.\n\nAll FLAC files that I upload are encoded at highest quality.  If the files seem a little large, that is why. \n\nIf you have any problems, comments, or suggestions, let me know. \n\nEnjoy, and seed, Seed, SEED!
